Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers.

When the choice of supply chain technology (integrative SC technology and functional SC technology) to support the alignment of the strategy will then strengthen the relationship between degree of fit with performance. Design/methodology/approach: Strategic alignment test between the functions uses 102 SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) in Yogyakarta Province, Indonesia with purposive sampling technique. The data are collected by distributing questionnaires to the companies that qualify the criteria of the sample, respondent target are procurement manager or production manager. Findings: Samples are grouped into two ideal types of strategies used mean split technique. 53 SMEs adopt ASCS (Agile Supply Chain Strategy) and 49 SMEs adopt LSCS (Lean Supply Chain Strategy). Two of the strategy groups have a low value of misfit score; it means that the degree of fit between supply chain strategy and manufacturing strategy is high. The result of the hierarichal moderated regression test shows that a regression coefficient values is negative both in LSCS and ASCS group, but the hypothesis test is only proven on ASCS group while LSCS group is not significant. The test of the moderate effect of the choice of SC technology on the two strategy groups is proved to be significant. Research limitations/implications: (1) The empirical finding of bivariate fit model test encourage a research space to explore the other contingent variable besides manufacturing strategy. For example, other function or corporate strategy. (2) The measurement of the company performance becomes the objective of the success of the alignment of supply chain strategy with the contingent variable which should be specified using the supply chain performance. Originality/value: The use of Euclidean distance formula is expected to cover the technical limitations of contingency test by using interaction approach between the complex variables; the value of misfit score reflects the extent to which program alignment between the company functions."

Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review."

The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which supply chain technology moderates the relationship between supply chain strategies and performance of large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. Proportionate sampling was used to obtain a sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large scale manufacturing firms. The descriptive statistics, reliability and validity tests of the constructs, correlation analysis, regression analysis and factor analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that there is a strong significant relationship between supply chain technologies, supply chain strategies and firm performance, implying that both supply chain technology and supply chain strategies explain 88.2% of the changes in the firm's performance. The net effect of both supply chain strategies and technologies is explained by the coefficient of product moderating variable (SC Strategy*Technology beta = 0.532) which shows that supply chain technology is a significant moderator of the relationship between supply chain strategies and firm performance. This study cleared some contradictions to support the position that firms should invest in supply chain configurations and technologies that lead to improved service delivery accompanied by enhanced operational and overall firm performance"

Companies are struggling to find ways to improve their reliability, responsiveness, agility, and costs and in turn competitiveness by changing their operations through adopting new supply chain technology. Even though information technology is widely implemented and studied in countless different contexts, but the clarifications between information technology and supply chain technology are still unclear. In this study, the diversity between information technology and supply chain technology is interpreted through a thorough and comprehensive review of the literatures. From there, the evolution of supply chain technology is undoubtedly tracked and the classification of supply chain technology has been clearly stated.

It has powerful information traceability function. The blockchain technology plays an important role in monitoring product quality and responding to product safety problems. Under considering the traceability awareness of consumers and the cost of using the blockchain technology, should the supply chain adopt the blockchain technology? The research on this issue deserves great attentions. In this paper, for a three-stage supply chain consisting of a supplier, a manufacturer and a retailer, we study the optimal pricing strategies of the supply chain considering the traceability awareness of consumers in two scenarios. These two scenarios are: scenario N (i.e., the supply chain does not adopt the blockchain technology) and scenario B (i.e., the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology). On this basis, we discuss the conditions that the supply chain adopts the blockchain technology by comparing the optimal profits of the supply chain and its members in two scenarios. Further, we discuss the problem of supply chain coordination when adopting the blockchain technology. The results show that it is conditional for the supply chain to adopt the blockchain technology, and the condition is related to the traceability awareness of consumers, the production costs of the supplier and manufacturer, and the cost of using the blockchain technology. We also find that under a certain condition, the revenue sharing contract can realize a Pareto improvement for the supply chain that adopts the blockchain technology."

Hence, it is reasonable to conjecture that firm's operating in these types of environments might rely on and use SCT and the information they provide to manage their supply chain operations differently from firms in less constraining environments. To explore this phenomenon we conducted a grounded theory study collecting interview data from 46 logistics and supply chain managers at 16 firms across India, one of the largest and most dynamic of the developing countries. Our analysis of the data establishes that SCT constraints arise from external, internal, and relationship conditions. Emerging from the data we observed managerial emphasis on a phenomenon whereby management utilizes coping strategies to relax constraints that adversely affect their use of SCT. While our findings also revealed human intervention as a negative externality arising from the use of coping strategies, we found that management were aware of this externality and were actively addressing it as part of their efforts to relax the constraints on SCT."

Findings: The hype around the opportunities that digital ledger technologies offer is high. For OSCM, a myriad of ways in which blockchain could transform practice are identified, including enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management; reducing illegal counterfeiting; improving sustainable supply chain management; advancing inventory management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new product design and development; and reducing the cost of supply chain transactions.

Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place in a distributed, decentralized and immutable way. Supply Chain Management is a broad range of activities that involve the management of the flow of goods and services, from the point of inception to the point of consumption. Blockchain technology can i) assure provenance tracking and traceability across the supply chain management ii) improves the quantity, quality and access to information at every step of the way across the chain iii) provides a more transparent way to provide data or information at a given instance of time. Blockchain technology can also be adapted in the supply chain management to overcome its disadvantages. The paper shows different case studies where the benefits of applying blockchain technology in supply chain management are appealing that has shown many benefits. It highlights the cases that have reduced fraud and errors; mitigate risks and provide data transparency and privacy, etc. The paper shows the creation of a general blockchain network and the information passing mechanism which is used to pass the information among the participants across the supply chain. With information passing mechanism we can provide data transparency to the consumers across the supply chain."

However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects."

BCT promises to change the way individuals and corporations exchange value and information over the Internet, and is perfectly positioned to enable new levels of collaboration among the supply chain actors. The book reveals new opportunities stemming from the application of BCT to SCF financing solutions, particularly reverse factoring - or approved payables financing. To do so, it first identifies the principal barriers and pain points in delivering financing solutions. Then, a possible blockchain-driven supply chain model is defined. Using this framework, the book subsequently discusses relevant use cases for the technology, which could open up new opportunities in the SCF space. It demonstrates that blockchain and distributed ledgers technologies could deliver substantial benefits for all parties involved in SCF transactions, promising to expedite the processes and lower the overall costs of financing programs. Industry giants such as IBM, Maersk, China-based Dianrong and FnConn (a Foxconn subsidiary) are currently working to digitize the global, cross-border supply chain using blockchain technology, and will likely soon create blockchain platforms for supply chain finance. These solutions aim to reduce complexity and make data sharing more secure, accurate and efficient.

More specifically, European Union regulations mandate food producers to trace all raw materials/ingredients used throughout their supply chain operations. Consumers also place high expectations on food supply chains (FSC) with specific emphasis on facets related to safety. However, the complexity of modern FSC networks and their fragmentation act as barriers for the development of sound traceability mechanisms. This paper aims to develop a distributed functional model to provide decentralized and automated FSC traceability based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. For assessing the feasibility of the proposed modeling approach, a food traceability use-case scenario is presented. The applicability of the model is further illustrated by the development of a fully functional smart contract and a local private blockchain. The overall benefits of the proposed model are assessed based on a set of predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The results are of significant value to both practitioners and researchers."

Design/methodology/approach: Using an abductive research approach, a qualitative content analysis was conducted on 126 cases of firms attempting to implement a blockchain technology-enabled supply chain system (BCTeSCS). These firms spanning across multiple industries were identified using the Nexis Uni database. Findings: Findings reveal that present BCTeSCS efforts are more-oriented toward improving operational-level capabilities (information sharing and coordination capabilities) than strategic-level capabilities (integration and collaboration capabilities). These operational and strategic-level capabilities alongside BCTeSCS deliver several supply chains performance outcomes such as quality compliance and improvement, process improvement, flexibility, reduced cost and reduced process time. However, outcomes may vary by industry type based on their uncertainties. Research limitations/implications: Given the nascent state of BCT, accessibility to primary data about ongoing BCTeSCS efforts is limited. The presented framework is based on 126 cases of secondary information. Within this constraint, the paper finds scope to future empirical research by proposing a resource-based framework of BCTeSCS and related propositions.

The distributor has access to private market demand information and decides whether to share information with the manufacturer. We investigate three kinds of remanufacturing scenarios, namely (1) the manufacturer taking the responsibility for remanufacturing, (2) the manufacturer licensing the distributor to undertake remanufacturing, (3) the manufacturer licensing the third party to conduct remanufacturing. We adopt Stackelberg game to obtain equilibrium decisions of each remanufacturing scenario with/without information sharing. We show that, regardless of whether technology licensing exists in remanufacturing models, information sharing always results in a profit increase to the manufacturer and the third party, whilst a profit loss to the distributor. Such profit loss of the distributor can be effectively reduced with the introduction of technology licensing in each remanufacturing model. As for the remanufacturing choice, if the distributor/the third-party saving unit cost is high enough, the manufacturer would prefer distributor/third-party remanufacturing mode with information sharing instead of manufacturer-remanufacturing mode as he could share more remanufacturing benefits by charging a licensing fee from the distributor/the third party. Our study extends and complements prior research that has only examined remanufacturing mode combined with either technology licensing or information sharing."

Previous literature often cites information technology (IT) and supply chain collaboration as direct contributors to product innovation and IT as a direct enabler of supply chain collaboration. This suggests that IT could have an indirect effect on product innovation through supply chain collaboration, although this relationship has not been addressed yet. This paper aims to analyze empirically the direct impacts of IT and supply chain collaboration on incremental and radical product innovation and the indirect effect of IT on both types of product innovation through supply chain collaboration by using data collected from a sample of 200 manufacturing firms. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to check the research hypotheses with a sample of 200 manufacturing companies. Findings: The results show supply chain collaboration has a positive effect on technological innovation, showing that the collaboration with external agents foster both incremental and radical innovations. Furthermore, results show that IT directly enhances both types of product innovation (incremental and radical) indirectly through supply chain collaboration. Research limitations/implications: This article supports the pursuit of open innovation that suggests the need to acquire external knowledge to be able to develop innovation projects. The use of tools that facilitate this transmission of knowledge becomes indispensable in environments in which companies must be involved in supply chains in which different external agents intervene and in which collaboration can promote the creation of synergies and superior competitive advantages. Practical implications: Innovation requires more and more the use of knowledge management practices that capture external information to be used in the creation of new products. In this case, collaboration within a supply chain facilitates incremental and radical innovations. However, to strengthen this transfer of information and the adoption of behaviors that stimulate innovation, the company must use ITs. Originality/value: This paper focus on the indirect effect of IT on product innovation through the creation of the collaborations with external agents. In spite of the importance of this relation, it has been poorly studied by previous literature. The paper’s greatest interest lies in the fact that ITs not only facilitate the transmission of knowledge but also facilitate other types of behavior among supply chain agents that invite collaboration and generate innovations."

Design/methodology/approach: Based on extant literature, a hypothesized model was developed and tested using structural equation modelling (i.e. AMOS). A survey was conducted to collect data from the supply chain managers of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies (more precisely in the food and beverage sector) in Thailand. Findings: The study findings suggest that through an ongoing relationship, trust evolves and is shaped over time and can form a competitive capability that may not be easy for competitors to replicate. Both trust and technology are found to have significant impact on supply chain collaboration and on firms’ operational performances. Research limitations/implications: One of the major limitations of the study is that the data were obtained from one single economy, which restricts its generalizability across other economies. The study was a cross-sectional and descriptive sample of the FMCG industry at a given point in time. A more stringent test of the relationships between trust, technology, supply chain collaboration and operational performance requires an in-depth case study or longitudinal study. Practical implications: The findings will enable supply chain managers in the FMCG industry to understand the strategic role of trust and technology in building supply chain collaboration that leads to superior operational performance. Originality/value: The paper clearly confirms that trust and technological capabilities are significantly associated with supply chain collaboration and operational performance. Most of the earlier supply chain collaboration research streams are based on developed economies where supply chain collaboration challenges are predictable, while the current study conducted is based on a developing economy setting. This study facilitates the author’s understanding of the challenges in managing supply chain collaboration within a developing economy."

At the R&D stage, we assume that there are some uncertainties both in terms of performance of the developed technology and market uncertainties. These uncertainties are resolved in the sales stage, as technology matures and information about consumers’ preferences become available. Further, the OEM can license the technology to a third party and share the revenues with the CM. We characterize equilibrium pricing and licensing strategies in two scenarios, namely, the licensing decision is made before or after the uncertainties are resolved. A comparison of the two equilibria indicates that the OEM is indifferent between making the licensing decision in the first or the second stage in most cases. But when the market potential, competition intensity, royalty rate and revenue sharing rate are moderate, there exists a small region in the parameter space where the OEM prefers to make the licensing decision in Stage 2. Interestingly, we obtain that for a large region of the parameter space, the two partners have the same preferences in terms of licensing. It is also found that different probability distribution of stochastic technology efficiency results in different licensing strategies."

During few decades, EDI (electronic data exchange) was the main technology supply chain professionals used to send and receive information. Recently, with the rise of the fourth industrial revolution and the Internet of Things (IoT), many aspects of the business environment have changed. Individuals and organizations are required to be more productive. One of the mainstreams for the business environment is blockchain. Some researches argued that bitcoin is the pioneer of blockchain technology. Financial companies joined forces to build a technological infrastructure to use the cryptocurrency on the market. The first blockchain conceived in 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis and it has never been hacked. Supply chains are complex networks of distant, separate entities that exchange goods, payments, and data across a dynamic, continuously evolving landscape. Blockchain technology allows visibility providing the customer the opportunity to understand how the supply chain works and how to get more information about products traceability. However, there are some challenges to implement blockchain in logistic and supply chain. The paper presents a theoretical review including the principles of the blockchain operations and the required infrastructure to implement it.

Information is crucial to supply chain performance because it provides the foundation on which supply chain processes execute transactions and managers make decisions. Without information, a manager cannot know what customers want, how much inventory is in stock, and when more product should be produced or shipped. In short, information provides supply chain visibility, allowing managers to make decisions to improve the supply chain's performance.

Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer’s optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer’s optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer’s blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer’s order quantity is low, the manufacturer’s blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer’s order quantity is high, the manufacturer’s blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved.

However, there is scant literature investigating the decision on technology licensing and its impact on a supply chain member's production and collection decisions. To address this gap, we consider a manufacturer, as the patent holder, who produces new and remanufactured products and, simultaneously, he and a remanufacturer (as the licensee, who by law can only produce remanufactured products) competitively collects used products from the market in a two-period closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). We investigate two licensing patterns, fixed fee versus royalty, within the CLSC in a Cournot duopoly model. We find that royalty licensing is dominated by fixed fee licensing from the viewpoints of both the consumer surplus and environmental protection. Our result also shows that the manufacturer's optimal licensing strategy is determined by a threshold of the fixed fee: when the fixed fee is below a threshold, it is better for the manufacturer to use a royalty licensing, whereas fixed-fee licensing should be used when the fixed fee is higher than a threshold."

Product technology transfer is a key activity in the complex process of new product development and is the fundamental link in the technology supply chain. Product technology transfer too often is dealt with in an ad-hoc fashion. Purposeful- management of the product technology transfer process leads to more effective transfers in terms of timeliness, cost, functional performance, and competence building. Better management of product technology transfer gives firms access to a greater variety of new technology options, improves a firm's ability to offer significantly differentiated products, deepens the firm's competitive competencies, and positively influences sustained product development success. The central objective of this article is to gain insight into product technology transfer so that companies can manage this process more successfully and so that researchers can investigate this critical activity further. This article describes the technology supply chain as a unique form of a supply chain that poses a set of managerial challenges and requirements distinguishing it from the more traditional component supply chain. Because a single product technology transfer project is the fundamental piece in the technology supply chain, understanding this piece well is key to leveraging the extended technology supply chain and to improving overall product development performance. This article integrates literatures on new product development, supply chain management, and technology management and builds on organizational theory to present a conceptual model of determinants of product technology transfer success. The core proposition is that product technology transfer effectiveness is greatest when companies carefully match (or ""fit"") the type of technology to be transferred (the ""technology uncertainty"") with the type of relationship between the technology supplier and recipient (the ""interorganizational interaction""). A quite detailed framework characterizing technology uncertainty along the dimensions of technology novelty, complexity, and tacitness is presented to help in assessing the challenges associated with transferring a particular product technology. This article also considers detailed elements characterizing the interorganizational interactions between the technology source and recipient firms. This helps firms consider the appropriate means to facilitate the inter firm process of technology transfer. Overall, this article provides practical insight into characterizing technologies and into improving the product technology transfer process. This article also provides a strong theoretical foundation to aid future research on product technology transfer in the technology supply chain."

After adopting the QRS, sustainability issues such as greenhouse gas emission and energy waste may be more serious as production lead time is shorter. In this study, due to this dilemma, we develop a two-stage quick response supply chain with cleaner technology, where the manufacturer determines the cleaner technology investment and afterwards the retailer decides the ordering quantity. Based on Bayesian theory, we depict an information updating process for the QRS with cleaner technology. First, we find that the inventory service level significantly affects both manufacturer’s and retailer’s performance under the QRS with cleaner technology. Moreover, our analytical results indicate that the performance of centralised supply chain system is always better than the decentralised one. As a result, we propose two supply chain contracts, minimum ordering quantity (MOQ) and MOQ with buyback (MOQ-BB) to achieve supply chain coordination. Comparing with the MOQ, the MOQ-BB is more flexible to allow better allocation of the ‘additional’ expected profit between the channel members through the buyback price negotiation."

This novelty is further seen in the proposition that blockchain can achieve this objective. Blockchain's distributed ledger framework achieves improved inventory control, improved demand forecasting, and more efficient just-in-time productivity as factors to reduce cost-loading in the global supply chain. Another novel contribution of this paper involves the assertion that blockchain's very methodology of requiring the confirmation of every single process by every single node in the network works to smooth out variation in the supply chain. Also, blockchain's ability to anticipate fluctuations in the supply chain that traditional SCM platforms cannot also works to reduce volatility because production can be increased or decreased in advance of anticipated variations. Blockchain also works to ensure that administrative fluctuations and variances do not adversely affect the supply chain. Blockchain more seamlessly supports contract formulation and exchange, smart contracts, remotely managed containers and cost reductions which all improve the JIT operating environment. Additionally, unlike traditional supply chain technology platforms like ERP and similar, blockchain allows every party involved in SCM to access the virtual supply chain in real-time. The contributions regarding blockchain and the global supply chain then are such that blockchain allows supply chain operators and retailers to more accurately assess costs per unit for forecasting purposes. This allows costs to be reduced over time and in an incremental fashion."

We find that each member of TSC can benefit from processing CI in OSC.

Then, the price interval of manufacturer charging for CI sharing is discussed. Finally, some managerial insights are obtained from numerical analysis. The key contribution of the paper lies in analyzing different TSC cooperation models and their equilibrium values and discussing the acceptable price of TSS for CI sharing under the influence of free-riding strategy.

By assuming that demand is uniformly distributed, and considering the factors of the fixed investment cost, tag price and shrinkage recovery rate, both RFID and non-RFID cases are analyzed under two scenarios: (1) in the centralized supply chain, the Newsvendor model is applied to investigate the impact of applying RFID technology on inventory control policy and supply chain profit; (2) in the decentralized supply chain, the wholesale price contract is formulated to characterize the supply chain partners' decisions on ordering quantity, wholesale price and profits.

Wholesale price and cost sharing contracts are considered in the supply chain. We list some main conclusions here. First, as carbon trading price increases, the optimal production quantities (the optimal abatement levels) firstly decrease (increase) and then remain constant. Second, both wholesale price and cost sharing contracts can coordinate the supply chain. Last, combining the optimal operational decisions under the two contracts with two-part tariff agreement, we design a contract in which the retailer pays a lump fee to the manufacturer, and find that there is an interval of the lump fee to achieve Pareto improvement for the two firms."

General systems theory and the contingency approach serve as theoretical underpinning. Findings - Not only the internal processes and management activities, e.g. in manufacturing and order fulfillment, of producers are affected by a changeover to AM, but also the SCM processes and components relating to the supply and demand side of a firm's supply chain. Endogenous and AM technology-related factors are contingency factors that help to explain differing effects of AM technology adoption on SCM processes and SCM components.

Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer's order quantity is low, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer's order quantity is high, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved.

The financing risk of the supply chain's carbon emission technology investment could be available as complete or incomplete information to its competitor. We find that the financing risk of carbon emission technology upgradation does not affect either chain's choices of equilibrium quantities and prices in the complete information case. If this information is incomplete for the traditional supply chain, financing risk plays an important role in determining optimal quantities and optimal prices. To encourage the use of clean energy technology to reduce carbon emissions, government should use the per-product carbon emission tax to encourage the traditional supply chain to upgrade its carbon emission technology, and should encourage financial institutions to provide preferential loans to the supply chain that has carbon emission technology disadvantage in the market."

However, the implementation of closed-loop supply chain is confronted with numerous barriers and challenges due to uncertainties in input as well as in process. In contrast to manufacturing process where the input is mostly homogeneous raw material, the reverse chain's input comes from product's end-of-use or end-of-life; therefore the timing, quality and quantity are uncertain. The recovery process also brings other challenges due to various quality grades of the product returns and various recovery options. On the other hand, information technology has been studied extensively in relation to supply chain management. Most of the works show that the use of information technology could enhance supply chain performance. However, the study on the importance of information technology in closed-loop supply chain is still limited. In this paper, we discuss the role of information technology and then propose a conceptual framework of decision making in adopting IT in closed-loop supply chain management.

With the emergence of blockchain technology, more and more companies in different industries have considered using it to support supply chain finance. Despite the very high interest from international and national financial institutions, and also enterprises from the real sector of the economy demonstrated in the distributed data storage technology, studies on the problems of assessing the use of the supply chain platform potential in the socioeconomic environment, and their theoretical understanding can be met vary rarely. As a rule, existing works reveal either the technical side of the object of study, or the regulatory or legal aspects of the applicability of supply chain technologies in the national economy. This paper attempts to overcome this conditional vacuum of understanding in order to make up for conditions with questions revealing other aspects of the subject of research, for example, such as the economic and social effects of introducing blockchain technologies into the activities of business entities. The banking sector of the national economy of the Russian Federation was chosen as the object of research. The research subject is the relationship built between participants in the financial market on the basis of supply chain technologies and the resulting effects expressed in the potential to reduce the credit risks of banks due to non-fulfilment, untimely or incomplete fulfilment of financial obligations by debtors. In the course of the study, the main directions that reduce the risks under consideration as a result of minimizing opportunistic models of behavior are substantiated and possible economic effects for the Russian banking system as a result of the use of blockchain technologies are identified. The opportunities for supply chain finance offered by possible applications of blockchain technologies in the supply chain and the capacity of this technology to deal with the existing barriers and pain points.

It provides information flow that makes the supply chain more robust and resilient without undermining its efficiency. Smart systems use artificial intelligence methods for solving problems and facilitating decision-making through rule-based deduction. Accordingly, these systems can present specialists' skills and simulate their thinking process. The primary goal of expert systems is to implement knowledge acquisition process by converting knowledge to wisdom. This process is vital for critical decision-making regarding important issues such as determining necessities of a particular contract. Companies use professional liability insurance of the products and services to ensure the purchasers and prevent potential losses. Although this practice is highly prevalent, there is not any particular procedure for measuring necessities of contracts. The main purpose of this paper is to design a fuzzy expert system for measuring the necessities of professional contracts regarding insurance coverage and improve the supply chain management using IT. This system can measure and report these obligations, considering specifications of each project. Taking into perspective variety of professional services/products, we consider software as a type of professional contracts, extract its important indices and give it to the system as the input. After the necessary stages, the system produces a proper response and presents the generated response to the user. The software of this expert system is web based, and there are four operating layers in its architecture. We implemented this program in MS Visual Studio Framework with C#.NET programming language. Moreover, we implemented MS SQL-Server Database Management."

However, earlier research lacks 1) an integrated framework that corresponds to diverse processes for supply chain management and 2) an explanation of how IT flexibility affects firms’ performance in the supply chain context. To fill these gaps, our study theorised a research model by integrating disparate streams of IT flexibility research with three types of IT flexibility, namely, operational, transactional, and strategic, and tested both the direct and indirect effects of the three IT flexibility types on firm performance. Our theoretical model uses an extended resource-based view to highlight the role of IT flexibility in managing interdependent firm relationships in supply chains. Using a partial least squares approach to structured equation modelling analysis on 162 questionnaires from supply chain practitioners, we found two significant relationships: (1) transactional IT flexibility affects operational IT flexibility, and (2) operational IT flexibility affects strategic IT flexibility. Transactional IT flexibility also affects strategic IT flexibility, thus playing a pivotal role in the effectiveness of the other two flexibility types. In addition, it was identified that transactional and operational flexibilities affect firm performance indirectly, via process integration capability, while strategic flexibility directly affects firm performance. By classifying diverse IT flexibility attributes into three types, a comprehensive and explicit concept of IT flexibility in inter-organisational relationships is attained, which allows practitioners to target key resource investments to realise the full potential of IT in the supply chain."

Incorporating information sharing and learning effect plays a significant role in determining the efficiency and the benefit of supply chain. Therefore, this study investigates the interaction between information sharing and learning effect in a closed-loop supply chain by developing three remanufacturing modes including no-remanufacturing, original equipment manufacturer remanufacturing and third-party remanufacturer remanufacturing under technology licensing. The results demonstrate the information sharing and learning effect have a negative impact on the procurement price and procurement quantity. A higher procurement price would be achieved under information sharing scenarios compared to no information sharing scenarios when the retailer reveals a larger demand information to the manufacturer. Since the original equipment manufacturer can make more accurate pricing decisions based on the shared information, he can obtain more payoffs when he receives demand information from the retailer. Comparatively, the procurement price in third-party remanufacturer remanufacturing scenario is higher than that in original equipment manufacturer remanufacturing scenario if the learning effect factor is relatively large. Moreover, the learning effect can bring a payoff increase to the original equipment manufacturer because a higher learning effect factor can save more production cost. These results can help achieve an optimal approach of learning effect and information sharing in a closed-loop supply chain with technology licensing."

In the wake of Bitcoin’s success, the retail industry sees potential in using blockchain technology to tackle some of these challenges. While blockchain technology itself has been subject to extensive research lately, the intersection between blockchain technology and supply chain traceability is still rather unexplored. Since the industry wishes to better understand the benefits and limitations of the technology in their context, this study aims to guide businesses in this assessment. Purpose The purpose with this thesis is to develop a framework for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology in supply chain management to improve traceability. Methodology A sequential method was used with three phases: 1) a literature review on existing theory which condensed to a theoretical model, 2) an interview study with experts in relevant fields to improve and adjust the model, and 3) an interview study with business representatives to validate the model and also to reach conclusions on the applicability of blockchain technology in this context. Conclusions The evaluation framework was successfully developed. In the evaluation, businesses first identify the drivers for traceability, and map the current traceability system to identify what improvements are needed to satisfy the driver. Secondly, key properties of blockchain technology are assessed, and a draft for an application is designed. Lastly, the drafted application is evaluated based on goal fulfilment, data requirements, degree of novelty and complexity of the application, and the inherent technical limitations of blockchains. Two hypothetical use-cases are presented in the study, and their limitations are discussed. The first case uses a blockchain for storing digital certificates of products to combat fraud, the second case uses a blockchain for storing the same type of traceability data as the companies store right now, only in a distributed fashion. While some properties of blockchain technology are aligned with some of the core concepts of successful traceability, it is still difficult to pinpoint exactly how blockchain technology should be used to effectively improve traceability."

To study this phenomenon, researchers have focused on one or some of these five salient factors: Information Technology Integration (IT), Inter-organizational Trust (TR), Relational Governance (RG), Transaction Cost (TC), and Supply Chain Performance (PE). In this study, we develop a research model that includes all these five factors by synthesizing and integrating theoretical perspectives: transaction cost economics, and relational governance. Our theoretical model clarifies the intricate relationships between the five factors by positioning two common resources for the supply chain: Inter-organizational Trust and IT, as the independent variables that influence outcome measures: performance, and reduction in transaction costs. Relational governance, which facilitates joint decision making, is theorized as playing a central role between the resources and the outcome measures. Data collected from 167 purchasing and supply chain managers provides strong support to our research model. Our findings should help researchers as well as practitioners to develop a more complete and transparent understanding of the relevant mechanisms with which the partnership resources, exert their beneficial effects on supply chain outcomes."

Varzandeh, et al. (2016) analyzed the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis as a product of three measurements. These three measurements include the probability of the occurrence and the severity of the effect and the ability of the process to detect the existence of the stated problems. Subsequently, for reducing RI, they suggest managers find ways to (1) reduce the chance of occurrences, or (2) reduce the severity of their impacts, or (3) improve detection capabilities at a time, or a combination of the three measurements together. This study expands on the previous research and explores the impact of technology on global supply chain risk. Following the recognition of the potential contribution of technology as a risk reduction tool, a survey instrument that measures the familiarity of the supply chain mangers and their usage of technology to control and to reduce risks is introduced. Responses from three groups of supply chain managers working for large, medium, and small companies are analyzed, and the results are reported. The results point to a need for increased awareness of potential known and unknown risks, and ever increasing use of technology to manage global supply chain risks effectively.

Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) were based on a structured questionnaire, then, data exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed. The conducted EFA determined four main factors for information management and integration in the supply chain that should be considered, namely, information characteristics, ICT used in information management, the scope of information and shared performance metrics. Results confirmed the importance of some of the factors related to information management in the supply chain, however having a different set of variables than indicated in the literature. Additionally, research introduced new factors, namely, information characteristics and the scope of shared information, instead of information quality and information content. Moreover, findings suggested that the key role in supply chain information integration was related to established technologies, focused on transport, customer, and ERP management, while emerging technologies, such as cloud computing and data mining were not of the top importance among the surveyed companies."

It is found that, when both market demand and supply quantity of used products face large-scale positive disruptions, the manufacturer's licensing behavior will be enhanced because he can extract more remanufacturing profits by charging a higher licensing fee. While if the negative disruptions of market demand and supply quantity of used products are large enough, the manufacturer's incentive to license the third party to conduct remanufacturing will be weakened due to a smaller remanufacturing profit shared from the third party. The manufacturer would adjust the wholesale price and the licensing fee to realize the maximum profit and coordinate the forward and reverse flows. Additionally, there exists a robust region for the production decisions and the licensing fee when the channel faces disruptions."

These characteristics are critically discussed with respect to the operating mode of blockchains, assessing the technology’s actual potential to improve these properties. Pitfalls and chances of blockchain technology itself and its use within supply chains are elucidated. The consideration of supply chain properties and pitfalls and chances leads to an implementation agenda, highlighting the importance of standardization and technology governance. This explorative study suggests that companies engage in a collective action initiative in order to agree on standards, rethink the role of certain industry players and establish participatory governance mechanisms.

It is often complex due to the rapid development of economic globalization and the intense competition pressure in the market which resulted in information sharing within a supply chain to be fragmented. Blockchain technology can solve this problem by having only a 'one trusted ledger' that could reshape the element of data trust. The goal of this paper is to identify and understand the impact of blockchain technology for information sharing within a supply chain. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology offers a high level of transparency and has gained the attention from various sectors to deploy this technology. A systematic literature review in the academic literature was conducted using different databases. Blockchain-enabled information sharing can add value to enhance collaborative work in different types of supply chains such as health and medical, construction and smart city. From our findings, one potential impact of deploying blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain is that it ensures all members in the chain can obtain verified information which enhances collaborative partnerships. Through this in-depth research, we highlighted potential barriers that could impede the development of blockchain technology in supply chain such as the lack of understanding of blockchain technology in businesses and conflict of interests. Future work such as information hiding, in parallel with information sharing, could close the gap in deploying this technology within a supply chain. Understanding the nature of different supply chain is also important to better prepare the deployment of blockchain. We acknowledge that our approach in selecting literatures in our systematic review may exclude certain literatures. Nonetheless, we tried to include as many relevant literatures as possible, to develop a roadmap on the current situation of blockchain-enabled information sharing within a supply chain."

Therefore, to fill this gap, the purpose of this paper is to develop and validate a dynamic SCAC model and assess both its direct and indirect impact on FPER using analytics-driven SCAG as a mediator. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on the emerging literature on big data, the resource-based view and the dynamic capability theory to develop a multi-dimensional, hierarchical SCAC model. Then, the model is tested using data collected from supply chain analytics professionals, managers and mid-level manager in the USA. The study uses the partial least squares-based structural equation modeling to prove the research model. Findings: The findings of the study identify supply chain management (i.e. planning, investment, coordination and control), supply chain technology (i.e. connectivity, compatibility and modularity) and supply chain talent (i.e. technology management knowledge, technical knowledge, relational knowledge and business knowledge) as the significant antecedents of a dynamic SCAC model.

However, the parties involved in the agrifood supply chain are numerous and physically dispersed, which makes data and information management difficult. As a result, the production process is not transparent and trust is difficult to build. In the horticultural sector, technological innovation in traceability is crucial from a economical point of view. An increasing demand in society for greater information about food reflects the need for more transparency. At the same time, more and more fresh products are accompanied by a variety of certification schemes, with an increasing risk of fraud and adulteration. Within this context, cooperatives of fresh fruits and vegetables can gain additional benefits from the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper seeks to make an initial contribution to the emerging public debate on this issue by providing an overview of blockchain and its application in agriculture, examining implications for food transparency and identifying some potential challenges for agri-food cooperatives. Based on the above reasons, the main purpose of this article is to conceptualize, design and test a traceability system of the agri-food supply chain based on blockchain technology that helps agri-food cooperatives to improve transparency regarding the origin and the processes incorporated into the product. Methodology A new model that involves blockchain and a smart contract to coordinate the tracking of food in the agriculture supply chain is presented in this paper. The food supply chain involves many different actors such as farmers, manufacturers, logistics, wholesalers, resellers, retailers and supermarkets. This system is currently inefficient and unreliable. In the current situation, much of the data and information on compliance are recorded on paper or stored in a centralized database. Through the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) in the field of agri-food supply chain traceability, the possible implications of the blockchain are explored. The PoC based on a case related to the berries of southern Spain is developed through the construction of a demonstrator that monitors the different nodes involved in the supply chain. The demonstrator is based on a previous analysis of the berries supply chain and the interactions between farmers, the cooperative, its certifiers, logistics providers, retailers and supermarkets, in order to allow a digital representation of a batch of berries to be associated with a unique and immutable digital certificate. To prove the origin and the traceability of the berries production and to be able to customize the roles of each actor in the supply chain with blockchain, the PoC concept was developed in a Spanish farmers cooperative with a permissioned ledger (hyperledger) and a smart contract. Results At the moment, few would question the relevance of blockchain to agri-food. The main question of adopting blockchain technology in the traceability of goods in the agri-food supply chain, is related to the added value compared to existing ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) solutions. This PoC has shown that it is feasible to incorporate basic information from the field and manufacturing processes, packaging and shipping into a chain of blocks with an authorized general ledger and a smart contract. Compared to traditional situations with centralized databases, the PoC demonstrator shows how blockchain can be used to ensure that different agents share the same level of information about the validity and provenance of inviolable certificates. This new supply chain architecture via blockchain can provide the relevant data to the participants, it can maintain confidentiality and can spread data effectively among the participants that use the blockchain technology. Therefore, the PoC pilot demonstrated that the blockchain technology could be used successfully in that context. Furthermore, given the experimentation carried out, it was shown that a medium-sized server (eg VPS in cloud) could function properly as a node for the purposes of this type of use case. There was also no need for special hardware, and the software infrastructure (eg Hyperledger Fabric) is open source and for free. During the development of the PoC, it was learned that it is important to maintain periodic dialogues between stakeholders in order to achieve a better understanding of the interests of each one and to identify common bases for the application of blockchain. The experience in this project shows that the meetings, in which different stakeholders presented and debated different use cases, are a good mechanism for expanding the agri-food blockchain ecosystem. Conclusions The advantage of this model over the centralized models is that all the products are tracked with blockchain and with this traceability it is possible to give confidence to the final consumers about the origin of the products because all the data and transactions carried out in the chain are recorded in the blockchain and managed through a smart contract. The PoC shows that this system is efficient, safe, transparent and avoids intermediaries, which results in lower costs while generating greater confidence in retailers, supermarkets and consumers, which is particularly beneficial for small farmers and cooperatives The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the blockchain technology for the various stakeholders in the fresh food chain, especially for cooperatives, being an opportunity for the improvement of reputation and competitiveness in a highly globalized economy. Several limitations were found for the PoC demonstrator. First, the amount of data and information that is shared is very limited. As with most PoC pilots, the project has not yet been able to demonstrate how the system would work when handling a large number of transactions. In addition, our demonstrator focused on a single smart contract. In practice, however, multiple smart contracts would need to be implemented for the different contractual relationships and to keep the transaction data visible only to the relevant subset of participants. Mistakes in the smart contract design have also shown that testing, validation and rigorous semantics are essential to avoiding significant damage to business relationships. Finally, to take full advantage of the power of blockchain, the adoption of this technology by several cooperatives is recommended. Most cooperatives are too small or have a lack of knowledge to invest in blockchain by themselves. In summary, blockchain is a promising technology for the competitiveness of cooperatives. The near future will show if blockchain technology will become a reliable and transparent way to provide a differential value for agri-food cooperatives."

This paper considers weight reduction technology selection and network design problem in a real-world corporation in China which produces, sells and recycles polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles used for soft drinks. The problem is addressed while taking consideration of future regulations of carbon emissions restrictions. First, a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to analyze the influence of economic cost and carbon emissions for different selections in terms of the weight of PET bottle, raw material purchasing, vehicle routing, facility location, manufacturing and recycling plans, etc. Then, the robust counterpart of the proposed mixed-integer linear programming model is used to deal with the uncertainty in supply chain network resulting from the weight reduction. Finally, results show that though weight reduction is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial, the increased cost due to the switching of the filling procedure from hot-filling to aseptic cold-filling and the incumbent uncertainties have impacts on the location of the Pareto frontier. Besides, we observe that the feasible range between economic cost and carbon emission shrinks with weightreduction; and the threshold of restricted volume of carbon emission decreases with the increase of uncertainty in the supply chain network."

The study administered a survey questionnaire to collect data from manufacturing firms in Malaysia with 112 respondents. A multiple regression analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between IT, IS, SCI, and FP. The study finds that IT and sharing has significant positive effect towards and performance. Firms that use IT and practice IS across partners in the supply chain are more likely to integrate their internal and external value chain for better performance both within and across the manufacturing firms in the supply chain. This study can be of interest to the manufacturing industry as well as other industry practitioners interested in improving the performance of the organization and supply chain in total. For supply chain practitioners, this results indicate that the firms should adopt IT and IS practices to strategically improve SCI. This in turn will also improve the supply chain network and firm’s performance. This study employs a newly developed framework which depicts the causal relationship between IT, IS, SCI, Supply Chain Performance, and FP in Malaysia. Furthermore, it closes a gap in existing literature by examining the effect IT and communication (ICT) practices toward manufacturing firms’ performance and SCP in a single setting.

Today's manufacturing companies are not striving for individual capacities but for the effective working with green supply chains. However, in addition to environmental and social objectives, cost and economic feasibility has become one of the most critical success factors for improving supply chain management with green component procurement collaboration, especially for the electronics OEM (original equipment manufacturing) companies whose procurement costs often make up a very high proportion of final product prices. This paper presents a case study from the systems perspective by using System Dynamics simulation analysis and statistical validations with empirical data. Empirical data were collected from Taiwanese manufacturing chains-among the world's largest manufacturing clusters of high technology components and products-and their global green suppliers to examine the benefits of green component procurement collaborations in terms of shared costs and improved shipping time performance. Two different supply chain collaboration models, from multi-layer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) and universal serial bus 3.0 (USB 3.0) cable procurements, were benchmarked and statistically validated. The results suggest that the practices of collaborative planning for procurement quantity and accurate fulfillment by suppliers are significantly related to cost effectiveness and shipping time efficiency. Although the price negotiation of upstream raw materials for the collaborative suppliers has no statistically significant benefit to the shipping time efficiency, the shared cost reduction of component procurement is significantly positive for supply chain collaboration among green manufacturers. Managerial implications toward sustainable supply chain management were also discussed."

Further, the study explored the moderating role of technology orientation on organizational culture dimensions and healthcare resilience linkages. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a multi-unit study of different hospital supply chains (SCs). Consequently, perceptual data were gathered from seven dominant entities in a typical medical/hospital SC: hospitals, hotels, chemistry and pharmaceutical, marketing/public relations/promotion, medical equipment manufacturers and surgical suppliers, food and beverage providers (i.e. restaurants) and insurance providers. The responses were gathered using online survey and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Based on 276 completed responses, positive influences were found for development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. As expected, a negative influence of hierarchical culture was found on HCRES. Further, technological orientation was found to enhance the positive effects of development, group and rational cultures on HCRES. However, no prominent moderation was noted for hierarchical culture’s influence on HCRES. The findings suggested managers to focus more on developing competing values framework (CVF)-based dimensions of organizational culture dimensions for effective risk mitigation so as to provide healthcare services in a timely manner to patients. Originality/value: The study is the first to investigate the effects of organizational culture’s dimensions on resilience. The study has empirically established the association between CVF view and dynamic capabilities. The study underlined the importance of resilience in healthcare SCs. Resilience is an important dynamic capability in healthcare SCs to provide uninterrupted treatments and services to patients. Any failure in such a service can be fatal.

The manufacturing and food supply chains are contributing significantly to the large-scale carbon emissions. Beef supply chain is one of the segments of food industry having considerable carbon footprint throughout its supply chain. The major emissions are occurring at beef farms in the form of methane and nitrous oxide gases. The other carbon hotspots in beef supply chain are abattoir, processor, logistics and retailer. There is a huge amount of pressure from government authorities to all the business firms to cut down carbon emissions. The different stakeholders of beef supply chain especially small and medium-sized stakeholders, lack in technical and financial resources to optimize and measure carbon emissions at their end. There is no integrated system which can address this issue for the entire beef supply chain. Keeping the same in mind, in this paper, an integrated system is proposed using Cloud Computing Technology (CCT) where all stakeholders of beef supply chain can minimize and measure carbon emission at their end within reasonable expenses and infrastructure. The integrated approach of mapping the entire beef supply chain by a single cloud will also improve the coordination among its stakeholders. The system boundary of this study will be from beef farms to the retailer involving logistics, abattoir and processor in between. The efficacy of the proposed system is demonstrated in a simulated case study."

However, at present, the implications of vertical strategic interactions for green technology investment in a supply chain are not all that clear. In particular, such a vertical interaction not only can translate into profits between different parties, but usually also involves differentiated environmental performance. A question which arises is: who is the right undertaker for green technology investment in a supply chain, the supplier or retailer? To answer this question, we highlight the implications of vertical strategic interaction for green technology investment in a supply chain. To fill this gap, using a game-theoretic approach, we formulate two models: (a) Model M, in which an upstream manufacturer adopts technologies to meet consumer demand; and (b) Model R, where a retailer integrates environmental concerns into their supply chain decisions. We find that the retailer, who is closer to the customer, is the more effective undertaker for green technology investment, as this not only creates higher profitability for both parties, but also achieves a more sustainable scheme for our environment. When green technologies are invested in by the manufacturer, the double marginalization effect not only may downward-distort their economic performance but can also reduce the equilibrium of product greenness."

This study used a quantitative approach, where the questionnaire as main tools for data collection. Data were analyzed by descriptive analysis and partial least square-path modeling (PLS- PM). Data computation used SmartPLS 2.0 Software. The results show that trust has a significant effect on supply chain performance, and it also has a significant effect on commitment. Furthermore, commitment has a significant effect on supply chain performance, and information technology has a significant effect on supply chain performance. Trust can improve the supply chain performance by commitment indirectly, and it gives smaller effect on supply chain performance directly than indirectly mediated by commitment. Then, supply chain performance is more influenced by information technology rather than trust and commitment. The results of this study may have implications for the important role of management in maintaining trust, commitment and utilizing information technology in the supply chain system"

Exploring these questions can contribute knowledge to the field of operations management: how firms can employ their IT capabilities for operations and supply chain management, the impact of competitive and institutional environments on IT-based operations strategy; the relationships between IT-enabled supply chain practices and operations performance. This paper addresses these aspects by examining the factors affecting Chinese firms' adoption of IT-enabled supply chain operations and the benefits they achieve, by drawing from and integrating the resource-based and institutional theoretic perspectives. It identifies key organizational and institutional factors that influence firms' technology adoption for supply chain management. Results show that firms can benefit by incorporating the technology within their internal operations processes and by using the technology externally with partners in their supply chain trading community. The results provide evidence that firms' IT engagement for operations and supply chain management is significantly influenced by institutional factors. Association analysis was conducted to understand the potential influence of external diffusion on internal assimilation. The result supports the theoretical claim. Building on the existing literature, this study demonstrates how resource-based theory and institutional theory can provide a solid theoretical backbone for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in efforts pertaining to technology adoption for operational supply chain excellence. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, the appropriateness of BT in Supply Chain Management (SCM) according to different sectors has been evaluated by using a MCDM methodology based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs). The suggested MCDM methodology consists of Delphi method, hesitant fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (HF-AHP) and Hesitant Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HF-TOPSIS) methods. In the first stage, the criteria and sub-criteria utilized for performance evaluation of BT in supply chain management have been determined by using Delphi method. The weights of main and sub-criteria have been obtained through HF-AHP method and finally, the alternative sectors have been ranked according to results of HF-TOPSIS method. For this aim, a hierarchical MCDM problem that consists of 5 main and 17 sub-criteria has been created and the alternative sectors have been evaluated. As a result, medicine/drug and jewelry sectors have been respectively determined as the most and the least suitable alternatives in order to implement BT by means of the proposed HFSs based methodology.

However, the existence centralized outcome has endured with confined data storage and lack of trust during the involvement of multiple parties. In order to overcome these issues, an approach of decentralized block chain is required by generating digital representation for physical goods to promote tracking over several entities. There are several existing challenges which involve lack in transparency, lack in traceability, complex in risk management, disruption, requirement for creating reputation and trust. Hence, one of the leading technologies is block chain which has the potential in resolving few coordination challenges in SCM by smart contract for handling the multiple exchanges between parties. Block chain technology has reduced the complexity, better transparency and verification of trustless oversupply chain. These can be done through smart contracts which provide a digital agreement among the transaction parties using ethereum during assist of writing computer code and even implemented in block chain that makes the client to self-execute while they are accommodated with predetermined situation.

This paper aims to extend the Verhoeven et al.’s (2018) framework and empirical research beyond the use case stage into the pilot stage. Design/methodology/approach: Three case studies in different industries (logistics services, consumer products and retail), supply chain positions (manufacturer, carrier, and retailer) and geographies (Europe and USA) are conducted to explore lessons learned by early adopters of blockchain technology in the supply chain. Findings: The case studies indicate that the Verhoeven et al.’s (2018) screens, with one added screen, are helpful in considering “what to adopt.” Based on the insights from the case studies, it is also possible to develop pilot design considerations that can inform “where to start.” Lessons learned include that there is value in scoping pilots in a targeted manner, including the use of existing technology in the pilot (as opposed to replacing existing technology) and that there is the ability to start a pilot fast, provided the existence of executive and stakeholder engagement. Practical implications: In addition to the need to be being mindful in considering what use case for blockchain in the supply chain to potentially adopt, mindful consideration of blockchain technology in the supply chain extends into the design of pilots. Six specific design considerations are offered. Originality/value: Based on the insights from early adopters in industry, the author extends guidance for the mindful adoption of blockchain in the supply chain beyond the development of use cases, into the design of actual pilots.

Although green supply chain learning has been suggested to be a crucial approach for enhancing innovative capability, whether and under what conditions it affects green innovation is still unclear. This study investigates the influence of two dimensions of green supply chain learning (i.e., green supplier and customer learning) on two types of green innovation (i.e., green product and process innovation) and the moderating role of green technology turbulence. Survey data collected from 249 Chinese firms were used to test research hypotheses. The findings show that both green supplier and customer learning positively influence green product and process innovation. However, green technology turbulence moderates these relationships differently. Specifically, green technology turbulence strengthens the impacts of green customer learning on green product and process innovation, while weakens the impact of green supplier learning on green process innovation. The moderating effect of green technology turbulence on the link between green supplier learning and green product innovation is insignificant. These results highlight the importance of learning from supply chain partners for sustainable development and firms' agility in adapting to external technological conditions in implementing their environmental practices."

Its application in supply chain management is also gradually increasing. Supply chain management (SCM) has long been committed to reducing costs and increasing efficiency and is trying to optimise resources and reduce the sector's fragmentation. Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures. Originality/value: This study builds upon an original data set and discusses features and applications of blockchain technology, explores the sources and dimensions of trust in supply chain management and explains the impact of blockchain technology on trust."

Steel is one of the most critical raw materials practically used in every aspect of our life, directly or indirectly influencing the industry and economy of a country. The final products of the steel industry can be reused at the end of their lifecycle, making the principles of reverse logistics applicable in the supply chain and turning it to a closed-loop supply chain. In this research, a multi-objective linear mathematical model under uncertainty is developed to optimize a steel sustainable closed-loop supply chain. The existed uncertainty is modeled through a scenario-based method in the stochastic environment, and the proposed multi-objective model is developed following a fuzzy goal programming approach. A real case study is explored in one of the active steel supply chains in Iran to validate the model. The model optimizes total profit, energy, and water consumption, CO2 emission, job opportunity created, and lost working days through determining optimal production technology, whether retailers get changed to hybrid centers or not, and the flow of material and products. The final results show that a mere 1% decrease in the profit can alleviate the harmful environmental effects by 5%. Finally, several managerial implications derived from final results and sensitivity analysis are discussed to provide insights for industry leaders who desire to increase their profits with regard to environmental and social effects."

The adoption of green technology can help enhance product greenness and reduce unit production cost. We identify the optimal pricing and the product greenness decisions for the retailer and the manufacturer, respectively. We extend our model to examine the effects of retail competition. As the manufacturer produces for both retailers, there are spillover effects on clean technology cost reduction. We find that the optimal greenness levels are increasing in the environmental taxes and when the coefficient of competition is higher, the greenness levels are also higher. We identify the spillover effects on sustainable supply chain with clean technology adoption: the spillover effects are higher, the degree of green technology is increasing.

While the process of disruption management has attracted considerable research attention, much of it has been directed at the pre-disruption stage. This study investigates the post-disruption stage, and its management. The unpredictability of disruption magnitude and nature suggests that the post-disruption management process may be as important, if not more so, than pre-determined pre-disruption strategies. An effective post-disruption management process would directly affect actual ability to recover from sudden and serious disruptions. This study analyzes six companies, variously positioned upstream and downstream in the supply chain of the information and communications technology (ICT) industry in Taiwan. Specific factors and strategies relating to the post-disruption management process were collected by conducting in-depth interviews with the managers and executives of the firms. The information was categorized into distinct disruption management process stages: discovery, recovery, and supply chain redesign. The study findings are interesting and at times, new and counter-intuitive, including the surprising positive effects of clustering in disruptions, and the role of back-up supplier and material verification in disruption recovery. The study emerges with an integrated framework that can be utilized to establish an effective post-disruption management process.

Interoperability is achieved by the development of a technology architecture that guides the design and implementation of communication systems existing within individual businesses and between businesses comprising the supply chain. Technology architectures are developed through a purposeful dialogue about why the architecture is required, the benefits and opportunities that the architecture offers the industry, and how the architecture will translate into practical results. An assessment of how the finance, travel, and health industries and a sector of the food industry—fresh produce—have implemented interoperability was conducted to identify lessons learned that can aid the development of interoperability in the seafood industry. The findings include identification of the need for strong, effective governance during the establishment and operation of an interoperability initiative to ensure the existence of common protocols and standards.

In this frame, the failure of inbound logistics potentially creates a severe implication to the automotive industry in terms of the financial effects, company image to damage the customer. Arguably, the supplier activities encompass the continuity of automotive components delivery, on-time delivery schedule, supplier and customer relationship maintenance, and financial operation. In this point, the problem identifies the distribution of automotive components and stock maintenance. Therefore, this qualitative research is essential to explore a proposed Blockchain Technology model in Supply Chain Management (BlcSCM), especially in the automotive component industry. On that basis, design science research methodology facilitates to create a proposed model, Leavitt Diamond. In this model, the essential factors (people, process, technology, and organization) merges with supply chain management. Finally, it refers to the Blockchain Technology model in Supply Chain Management."

The current trend is the time to integrate and to make the existing system smarter, automated and sustainable. Researchers are working on the integration of information and communication technology with the supply chain (SC) and continuously endeavor to achieve an efficient SC. This paper is an attempt to study the use of BC technology and a try to develop efficient sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) rather than the inefficient design of supply chain management (SCM). Important variables related to BC are identified from the literature after going through discussion with academician and industry experts. These variables are further analyzed and modeled using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fuzzy-Decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). PCA is applied to form the principal factor from these identified variables based on possible correlation. Although, the application of Fuzzy-DEMATEL is adopted to identify major causes that help to achieve sustainable supply chain (SSC) after integration of BC technology. The proposed integrated (incorporated) approach of PCA and Fuzzy-DEMATEL found six major causes namely Data safety and Decentralization, Accessibility, Laws and Policy, Documentation, Data management, and Quality. This study is revolving around the integrated approach of two streams namely BC-related Information technology and SC from Operations. This research represents the significant role of causes, which leads to the integration of BC with the SC resulting in achieving sustainability. BC technology is still in their nuance stage and this study will motivate researcher and industrial practitioners to achieve a more efficient and effective goal in SC practices to achieve sustainability."

The focal technology is licensed to specialist design firms and designed into products, which are fabricated by dedicated large-scale manufacturers. We examine a technology supplier's licensing decision in such emerging multiparty networked supply chains in which a downstream design firm's capability may not be publicly known. We find that the supply chain and firm profits are critically affected by whether or not a license agreement between a technology supplier and a design firm is kept confidential from a manufacturer. Instead of licensing to two downstream firms, a technology supplier may also license to an integrated firm with both design and manufacturing capabilities, which forms a conventional vertical supply chain. We compare a networked supply chain with a vertical supply chain and show that the network model can, under some conditions, outperform the integrated configuration and increase profits for all supply chain entities. In particular, a downstream firm can be better off decentralized, with design and manufacturing functions taken by different firms. Our research helps explain the emergence of such networked supply chains and offers insights on how to structure them to improve outcomes."

Implementing and executing these processes in a trusted, secure, efficient, globally accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and impact health outcomes adversely. Blockchain, combined with the Internet of things (IoT), is an emerging technology that can offer a practical solution to these challenges. Accordingly, IoT blockchain offers a superior way to track and trace products via a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger of the blockchain network.

The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm’s ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm’s ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization’s existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization’s ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events. Originality/value: This study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. The study further provides a counterpoint to the existing perspective within the supply chain risk management literature that institutional experience of managing past supply chain disruption events prepares the organization to deal with future disruption events. This paper adds to our understanding of how, by adopting BDA capabilities, firms can develop supply chain risk resilience from disruption events."

We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient.

We examine coordination problems and corresponding incentive mechanisms between a manufacturer and a retailer for jointly investing in a new technology that has the potential to improve the efficiency and security of the supply chain. We show that depending on the relative strength of the efficiency and security concerns, supply chain stakeholders in a decentralized supply chain face two different coordination problems in investing in the new technology: (1) when security concerns are not strong enough to dominate efficiency concerns, stakeholders may not have a sufficient incentive to invest; therefore, at least one stakeholder under invests. Our analysis shows that internal incentive mechanisms, such as investment cost sharing between stakeholders, are not likely to resolve this underinvestment; instead, external financial incentive mechanisms, such as tax incentives, need to be considered. (2) When security concerns are strong enough to dominate efficiency concerns, stakeholders may not invest at all because of the uncertainty of other stakeholders' behavior, rather than the lack of an incentive to invest in the technology. Our analysis shows that external interventions, such as imposing a penalty for a breach of security, can be used as a way of reducing such behavioral uncertainty. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation."

The majority of the relevant empirical literature identified price/cost, quality, delivery dependability, product innovation, and time to market as the most decisive sources of competitive advantage. As far as the standards in the economic environment are changing and global competition is fiercer, organizations realize that they have to re-evaluate their enterprise business model in order to gain supply chain efficiencies. To meet these challenges and improve their competitive advantage, companies need to both support their internal functions and exchange information with supply chain partners in an effective way. Therefore, companies must exploit IT including enterprise applications such as ERP and CRM, as well as e-procurement and e-commerce. The empirical findings from a survey of 76 manufacturing firms in Greece confirmed the crucial role of IT practices and techniques on the establishment of a sustainable competitive advantage based on Supply Chain Management.

However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains."

Four cases were investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews in the food supply chain. Eighteen boundary requirements were established, classified in the categories industry, policy, efficiency and traceability. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains while others were found to be specific to the supply chain. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, a joint platform and independent governance have been identified as key boundary conditions before the use of block chain. Our findings imply that supply chain systems need to be modified first and organizational measures need to be taken to meet the boundary conditions before the successful use of block chain can be achieved."

The results indicate that manufacturer's endurance capacity of reduction difficulty is higher in the cooperation model than in the Stackelberg game model, and that perfect coordination of supply chains can be realized by a revenue sharing contract. From the perspective of a consumer, low-carbon products mean higher price, so that subsidies or tax exemptions should be provided to keep low prices. Meanwhile, the government can promote investment in emission-reduction technologies and achieve its emission reduction targets by controlling emission trading price, strengthening emission reduction publicity and providing technology investment subsidies."

The study proposes a solution method, and the results show that investment in preservation technology reduces the total supply chain cost by 13%. Additionally, preservation increases the lot size, thus increasing the production cycle length, which reduces the ordering cost of the system. Furthermore, this study shows that preservation leads to a reduction of solid waste from deteriorated products. Total deteriorated products reduced to 8 units from 235 units, hence, preservation generates positive environmental benefits along with economic impacts. The robustness of the proposed model is illustrated with a numerical example, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations.

In this study, we investigate competitive and cooperative interactions in a closed-loop supply chain that includes an OEM and an IR. First, the OEM determines its quality level; according to which the OEM and the IR then choose their respective production quantities. Thus, the OEM's choice of quality level is essential to the subsequent quantity competition between the OEM and the IR. Moreover, two cooperative mechanisms between the OEM and the IR are developed: technology licensing with a licensing royalty and an R&D joint venture for technology co-development. We also investigate firm equilibrium decisions and profits in different models; consider the endogenous settings of cooperation schemes; and compare performance between the cooperative models. Furthermore, we extend our models to a dynamic setting to examine the effects of period and planning horizons on the equilibrium results.

We undertook a grounded theory study in the emerging market of India to investigate how SCT is implemented when subjected to prevailing institutional pressures. Based on an analysis of interviews with 50 supply chain managers, we find that early adopters of SCT experience significant and numerous unmet expectations associated with SCT implementation. These unmet expectations arise from competing institutional logics with the resultant isomorphic pressure causing the juxtaposition of two incompatible supply chains in India.

Its lure is irresistible because of the simplicity with which it can replace the standard methods of documentation, smooth out logistics, increase transparency, speed up transactions, and ameliorate the planning and tracking of trade. Blockchain essentially provides the supply chain with an unalterable ledger of verified transactions, and thus enables trust every step of the way through the trade process. Every stakeholder involved in that process - from producer to warehouse worker to shipper to financial institution to recipient at the final destination - can trust that the information contained in that indelible ledger is accurate. Fraud will no longer be an issue, middlemen can be eliminated, shipments tracked, quality control maintained to highest standards and consumers can make decisions based on more than the price. Blockchain dramatically reduces the amount of paperwork involved, along with the myriad of agents typically involved in the process, all of this resulting in soaring efficiencies. Making the most of this new technology, however, requires solid policy. Most people have only a vague idea of what blockchain is. There needs to be a basic understanding of what blockchain can and can't do, and how it works in the economy and in trade. Once they become familiar with the technology, policy makers must move on to thinking about what technological issues could be mitigated, solved or improved. Governments need to explore blockchain's potential through its use in public-sector projects that demonstrate its workings, its potential and its inevitable limitations. Although blockchain is not nearly as evolved now as the internet was in 2005, co-operation among all stakeholders on issues like taxonomy or policy guides on basic principles is crucial. Those stakeholders include government, industry, academia and civil society. All this must be done while keeping in mind the global nature of blockchain and that blockchain regulations need to be made in synch with regulations on other issues are adjacent to the technology, such as electronic signatures. However, work can be done in the global arena through international initiatives and organizations such as the ISO. Canada has an important role to play in developing international blockchain policy and furthering use of the technology. Estimates are that Canada will be among the top investors in blockchain, with a projected annual growth rate of nearly 90 per cent in just the next three years alone. Canadian policy-makers can take on a significant role in these early days by providing a hub for stakeholders and resources. Already, industry has begun experimenting on a wide scale with Blockchain. Walmart, for example, has created a blockchain food safety alliance that tracks, traces and monitors product safety from farm to grocery aisle. Blockchain has tremendous potential for relieving the pressure points and bottlenecks in trade supply chains. Its low investment costs are another asset that will help contribute to its widespread use in the next decade. Trade isn't the only place for blockchain; health care, data protection and voting security are all areas where blockchain can prove useful. With proper cooperation, governance and policies in place to regulate it, blockchain will soon become an accepted (unnoticed) part of many aspects of everyday life. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review and a theory-driven approach are used. A set of propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of BCT in supply chains can be understood to simultaneously enable and constrain SCM and performance. Findings: The analysis identifies four enabling and three constraining blockchain identities to explain how the technology either “facilitates” or “impedes” SCM and supply chain performance. Traceability, which emanates from its ability to provide data immutability, ranks highly as a core innovation of the technology. The blockchain is mainly seen as an opportunity to exploit existing supply chain resources and competencies. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of the research is its conceptual nature. Future research should test the developed propositions empirically. Further research should focus on BCT as an opportunity to explore and as a relationship-building technology. More research is also needed focussing on the complex and simultaneous enabling and constraining effects of BCT in supply chains.

In addition, the moderating effect of top management is explored. Design/methodology/approach: Using cross-sectional survey data collected from a sample of 105 Australian retail firms, this study used structural equation modelling to test the hypothesised relationship of cloud-enabled SCI with performance in a theoretical model. Findings: Results show that cloud-based technology has positive effect on SCI, and the cloud-enabled SCI is positively related to supply chain performance which eventually influenced firm sustainability. Further, top management intervention moderates the relationship between supplier and internal integration with supply chain performance. But it is found to have no moderating effect on the relationship between customer integration and supply chain performance. Practical implications: Recognising the potential benefits of emerging cloud-based technologies reported in this study, retail managers need to understand that higher order SCI requires the support of cloud-based technology to improve supply chain performance and firm sustainability. Originality/value: This research extends prior research of information and communication technologies-enabled SCI and its effect on supply chain performance which overly remains inconsistent. In addition, IS literature abounds with discussion on cloud computing technology per se, and its adoption in supply chain is overly rhetoric. This study fills this gap by conceptualising the multiple dimensions of SCI enabled by cloud-based technology and the way it affects supply chain and firm sustainable performance. Investigating SCI in context of cloud-based technology is a unique contribution in this study. The moderating effect of top management in this decision also adds to the current body of literature."

Being at the interface between technology, innovation, behavioral science and operations management research, this paper identifies multifaceted factors that determine the decision to adopt AM technologies for the production of industrial parts. A review of the relevant literature revealed eight potential factors. These can be classified into four interdisciplinary categories: technology-related factors, firm-related-factors, market structure-related factors, and supply chain-related factors. Special focus is placed on the impact of supply chain-related issues, because there are indicatives that these aspects have an influence on the decision to adopt AM technologies since AM may offer distinct opportunities for both, the supply- and demand-side of a firm’s operations. No work in the field of manufacturing technology adoption has examined the role of such inter-organizational factors before. The results of an empirical study among 195 firms indicate that demand-side benefits and compatibility are the main determinants of AM technology adoption. This suggests that not only intra- but also inter-organizational factors should be considered when investigating the adoption of technological innovations. Furthermore, it is carved out that the adoption of AM technologies has an interdisciplinary nature."

To control emissions, the port supply chain can implement either shore power (SP) or low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO). The performances of the port supply chain when either SP or LSFO is adopted are compared in this paper. More specifically, according to relative bargaining power between the port and the shipping company, three different game models are constructed to analyze the effects of channel power on equilibrium results when either SP or LSFO is implemented. Results show that both profits and carbon emissions of supply chain using SP are lower than those using LSFO when carbon price is low, but are higher when carbon price is high. However, from the perspective of the social welfare, when both the carbon price and environmental concern are low, or both the carbon price and environmental concern are high, LSFO should be adopted. Otherwise, SP may be more attractive. Compared with the two Stackelberg games, the Nash game leads to higher profits and less emissions. The Nash game also leads to higher social welfare when environmental concern is small, but lower social welfare when environmental concern is large.

Companies these days are continuously looking to expand their market geographically to attract new customers. With that in mind, the main concern of companies is to achieve their customers' requirements, which makes the supply chain (SC) longer and more complex. This leads to increased difficulty in managing the SC along with controlling risks and disruptions in SC. Such as loss of a critical supplier, a fire accident in the production facility, or an act of terrorism. To deal with these risks, SC must be designed to provide an efficient and effective response, keep its process working and be capable of recovering to their original state after disruptive events, this is considered as the core of supply chain resilience (SCRes). Furthermore, companies that design their SC with capabilities to react quickly to any disruptions in its process have the opportunity to become more stabilized and acquire an improved position in the market. Researchers have been exploring ways to acquire supply chain resilience, such as encouraging and improving collaboration between SC partners or by increasing the organization's visibility through monitoring SC events and patterns. Studies have shown that IT has a role in improving SCRes, such as information-sharing systems to promote collaboration and visibility tactics. However, recent research trends are exploring new and emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT). Despite the growing interest in IoT, minimal research has been carried out for its application in SCRes. Research in this direction is necessary to explore opportunities provided by IoT to redesign SC which in turn reinforces flexibility of supply chains and aspects of analysis of the product quality and how it could enable companies to improve their SCRes. This study is directly focused to identify and highlight this gap."

The study theorizes how the risk-mitigating effect of system modularity can be enhanced by the allocation of decision rights to the IT (information technology) unit. The main logic is that IT managers with more domain IT knowledge can better utilize their knowledge in decision making to achieve effective system modularity. We tested these theoretical propositions using a survey study of Chinese companies and found empirical support. We also found that the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit does not directly mitigate the perceived risk of digital supply chain systems, which highlights the role of decision allocation to the IT unit as a key moderator in risk mitigation.

We analyse the impacts of strategic consumer behaviour and the third-party remanufacturing cost on three kinds of remanufacturing scenarios, namely no-remanufacturing, partial-remanufacturing and full-remanufacturing. We adopt a Stackelberg game to obtain the equilibrium strategies of each remanufacturing model and show that the demand of new products decreases and the demand of remanufactured products increases as consumers become more strategic. Considering the manufacturer’s profit decrease due to strategic consumer behaviour, the manufacturer suffers a smaller profit loss when he licenses the third party to remanufacture because he can charge a higher licensing fee from the third party to share remanufacturing revenues. Moreover, the manufacturer prefers the third-party remanufacturing mode rather than the manufacturer–remanufacturing mode if the third-party remanufacturing cost is relatively low and remanufacturing can always bring a profit increase to both the manufacturer and the third party."

Specifically, there is a need to provide empirical and systematic analysis of the variables that can explain the various stages of mobile SCM diffusion. A review of recent literature suggests that existing e-supply chain technology adoption literature is not strongly grounded in theory. A theoretical model with six hypotheses was proposed based on the technology-organisation- environment (TOE) framework and innovation diffusion theory (IDT). This study draws its survey responses from a group of manufacturing firms in order to investigate the factors that affect the diffusion of mobile SCM.

We piloted a novel mHealth solution dependent only on short message services (SMS) technology that allowed workers in rural health centres in Zambia to report vaccine stock levels directly to an online platform. Small airtime incentives were offered to encourage users to engage with the system, as well as weekly reminder messages asking for stock updates. Methods: the primary outcome measured was the percentage-of-doses-tracked, calculated over the study period. Each vaccine box was randomly allocated to offer either a standard or double airtime incentive and either weekly or daily reminders, in a 2 x 2 design; ANOVA was used to calculate i f any of these factors affected time-to-reply. Results: over the study period, the total percentage-of-doses-tracked was 39.9%. Within the subset of users who sent at least one message to the platform, the percentage-of-doses-tracked was 93.8%. There was no significant difference in average time-to-reply between the standard airtime incentive and double airtime incentive groups, nor was there a significant difference between the standard r eminder and daily follow-up reminder groups. Conclusion: this pilot study found that in an active subgroup of health workers, an i ncentivised mHealth solution was able to collect tracking data for 93.8% of doses. More research is needed to identify methods to encourage healthcare workers to engage in timely stock reporting practices."

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of AM on spare parts supply chain. Three supply chain scenarios are investigated in this paper, namely conventional supply chain, centralised AM-based supply chain and distributed AM-based supply chain. Based on system dynamics simulations, this paper specifically compares three supply chain scenarios, in terms of total variable cost and carbon emission. The results show the spare part supply chain utilising AM is indeed superior to the traditional one in sustainable performance. It is also expected that AM can facilitate the spare parts supply chain to achieve more economic benefits along with its development. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the early studies that explores the impact of AM on supply chain performance and quantitatively examines the superiority of utilising AM in spare parts supply chain. Some suggestions are also provided to help managers adopting AM in their spare parts supply chains. 1. Introduction Currently, the biggest challenge in supply chain management is the need to efficiently and effectively deliver ever more valuable products and services to customers (Holmström et al. 2010; Christopher 2011). In the context of a spare parts supply chain, customer service is related to meeting customers' demands reliably and consistently to keep their equip-ment in operational condition. Maintenance, repair and operations are closely tied to the accessibility of appropriate parts whenever a customer requires them and to reduce downtime costs (Khajavi, Partanen, and Holmström 2014). Thus, the requirements for a spare parts supply chain differ from those of supply chains for other products in several ways: service requirements are higher as the effects of stock-outs may be financially significant, the demand for parts may be extremely sporadic and difficult to forecast, and the prices of individual parts may be very high (Huiskonen 2001). The ability to supply spare parts with high fulfilment rates at low costs therefore becomes both a strategic opportunity (Wise and Baumgartner 1999) and a challenge for many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) (Markillie 2012). Typically, companies must invest heavily in their spare parts supply chain operations to reach high fulfilment rates …"

ABSTRACT. Background: The efficiency of logistics processes is a very important decision-making aspect, both from financial point of view as well as in terms of processes at the operational level. Taking into account both the specific features of a cold supply chain as well as conditions of the comprehensive analysis of the efficiency of logistics processes, the significant aspect is the elaboration of the concept, which will allow to monitor and estimate realized processes with the possibility to obtain date in real time. The aim of this paper is to present the concept of monitoring of processes performed in a cold supply chain. Methods: The results of researches conducted in Polish companies in the first half of 2016 year as well as the literature review show the unsatisfied level of the use of the analysis of efficiency of logistics processes. These results were used to select conditions influencing the complexity of the analysis of efficiency of logistics processes. The researches were conducted in 152 logistics companies located in Wielkopolska voivodship. Results: The business product BluTrack of the Blulog company is the result of the elaborated concept. Various variants of the implementation of this tool in practice served as the methodology of the verification of the complexity of the implementation of this concept in monitoring and management of the cold supply chain. Conclusions: The analysis of efficiency of logistics processes is still not unambiguously defined despite many scientific studies. It causes problems in the business practice. The uniqueness of the cold supply chain introduces additional variables and criteria of estimation of efficiency of logistics processes. The presented study put the main focus on the use of mobile technologies for efficient monitoring and evaluation of efficiency of logistics processes in the cold supply chain. The result of the verification of the presented concept was the preparation of the tool, having the desired functionalities for the business practice."

Additionally, it intends to analyze the relation with supply chain performance through supply chain agility under the hypothesis that the supply chain related 4th industrial revolution technologies influence to the supply chain agility. As a result of analysis, we obtained the fact that the supply chain related 4th industrial revolution technology significantly influences to both supply chain agility and BSC suply chain performance. That is, we could find out that it grants the positive potentiality to all of the responsiveness of the supply chain, the flexibility and promptness of the supply chain, customer perspective, business process perspective, innovation and learning perspective, the supply chain performance in the financial perspective. In addition, because the supply chain related 4th industrial revolution technologies influence to BSC supply chain performance directly and significantly, it was found the supply chain agility has partial mediating effect between two factors. Because the supply chain agility significantly influences to the innovation, studying perspective and financial perspective among BSC supply chain performance, if the supply chain related 4th industrial revolution technology mediate supply chain agility, we can find that it has a positive effect on the rapid commercialization, the degree of data sharing, technical performance, profit margins by the supply chain partners, cash flow cycle, customer growth and profitability rather than the business process aspect of the customer or the supply chain itself."

Innovations related to AM supply chains are, so far, insufficiently understood, but their success will require firms’ awareness of their systemic nature and their firm-specific implications. The purpose of this paper is to explore the supply chain innovations dealing with AM in business-to-business supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative research design is used. Interviews were conducted in 20 firms, workshops were organized to map AM-related processes and activities, and supply chain innovations were analyzed. Findings: This study reveals practical changes in supply chains and requirements for AM-related supply chain innovations. While earlier research has centered on technology or firm-specific AM implementations, this study shows that fully leveraging AM will require innovations at the level of the supply chain, including innovations in business processes, technology and structure, as well as supportive changes in the business environment. These innovations occur in different parts of the AM supply chain and are emphasized differently within different firm types. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted in one country in the context of the machine building and process industry with a limited data set, which limits the generalizability of the results. The results offer an analytical framework and identify new research avenues for exploring the innovations in partial or complete AM supply chains.

Using transaction-level data from the U.S. Government’s General Services Administration, we study three layers of effects: the Monday Effect, the Technology Effect, and the Product Effect. First, we assess whether performance varies across days of the week in supply chain fulfillment, measured by order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage (i.e., the Monday Effect). Furthermore, we assess how information technology (IT), notably an electronic market, can mitigate such variations (i.e., the Technology Effect), and how product characteristics moderate such effects (i.e., the Product Effect). Our findings show that there indeed exist significant, systematic performance variations across days of the week, with Mondays having poorer performance than other days of the week, after controlling for workload and other factors. Further, we find that much of the performance variation can be reduced when an IT-enabled electronic market is adopted. Specifically, the performance gaps in order cycle time, complete orders fulfilled, and short shipment percentage are reduced by 94%, 71%, and 80%, respectively. We further find that IT improves not only the mean level, but also the variance, of operations performance. Finally, we find that the electronic market is most effective at mitigating the Monday Effect for less frequently transacted products, such as products of high value, products that are slow moving, and specialized products with small numbers of buyers. These findings suggest that measures can be taken to reduce fulfillment deficiencies, including using information systems to mitigate variations in operations management, leading, potentially, to operational continuity and higher service levels in the supply chain."

The paper adopts the exploratory study as research method, involving a producer of generic drugs and its main distributor. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews. In pharmaceutical supply chain, sharing information boosted by information technology translates into greater flexibility and reliability, lower costs, obtained through more reliable forecasting, and lower inventory requirements. There are few initiatives involving Information Technology (IT) applied to demand management in pharmaceutical supply chains available in the literature. It was found that the IT framework proposed in this research is adherent to the demand management of the focused pharmaceutical dyad. Other assumption was that, if partners processes integration exist, better supply chain performance is achieved. It was found that, by means of proposed tools and solutions, such as RFID and involved partners applications integration, this goal could be achieved. Because of the chosen research approach, results may be restricted to these specific dyadic processes. Further application of the proposed IT framework have to be tested. The paper identifies demand management strategic and operational processes that can reach a better performance by using the proposed IT framework. Based on the literature, were identified which IT requirements should be met to demand management processes optimization. Additionally, were applied questionnaires and interviews to the focused dyad personnel, to corroborate the data identified in the literature. Answers found in the case study link literature elements with those stated by respondents. Finally, based on this, was conceived an IT framework composed of three elements: 1.One specific for infrastructure, to enable data and systems interoperability among SC participants, considering a virtualized infrastructure environment (Cloud); 2. An information system solution to integrate partners applications, based on the reference component model structure (CORBA / CCM – Common Object Request Broker Architectures / Corba Component Model); 3. One element responsible for logistics operations, formed by fourth and fifth pieces: a tool to streamline the logistics flow, and to obtain prompt inventory data, provided by a RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) solution; and another to provide information about production and logistics lead times, applied to demand forecasts elaboration and to streamline the order fulfillment process, based on OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) solution.

Design / Methodology / Approach: This paper proposes a hypothesis model within the decision-making framework that offers strategic alliance tool for managers in the area of supply chain to operationalize business decisions. Samples of more than 210 primary data sets are collected from population of different industries in India by a proper sampling method and by framing questionnaires. The relationship, as proposed in the hypothesis model, is assessed empirically by using statistical techniques called Structural Equation Modeling.  Results: Practitioners may expect improved supply chain performance through strategic alliance between information intensive services and supply chain integration, as it is demanded industries in this Industry 4.0 era. Limitations: The hypothesis framed by western standards seems to be obvious; however, considering the Indian business scenario, where the supply chain and technology of information systems are almost a new concept in most firms, this seems to be a valid area of research. Practical Implications: Research conceptualizes and develops different dimensions of information-intensive services that offer empirical support for the adoption of proper information system to improve performance within an integrated supply chain. Originality / Value: This survey-based empirical research will ‘coordinate and highlight the issue of integration’ of Enterprise Information Systems within the organizational supply chain."

Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and provenance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs."

This is especially useful in the aircraft spare parts industry where currently there is a need to maintain a high level of safety inventory for high-cost long-lead time metallic parts. Therefore, more and more companies in the aerospace industry are interested in using AM technology. There are different approaches to configure the aircraft spare parts supply chain using AM technology. This paper evaluates the impact of AM in the aircraft spare parts supply chain based on the well-known supply chain operation reference model. Three supply chain scenarios are investigated; namely, conventional (as-is) supply chain, centralized AM supply chain and distributed AM supply chain. A case study is conducted based on data obtained in the literature. The result shows that the use of AM will bring various opportunities for reducing the required safety inventory of aircraft spare parts in the supply chain.

The current good distribution practice (GDP) guideline demands increased visibility from firms. The purpose of this paper is to propose a solution for SCV enhancements based on automatic identification (Auto-ID) technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors qualitatively analyze data from ten case studies of actors in a PSC. A review of Auto-ID technologies supports the derivation of solutions to enhance SCV. Findings: This work shows that the functionalities of Auto-ID technologies offered by current practical monitoring solutions and challenges created by the GDP guideline necessitate further SCV enhancements. To enhance SCV, the authors propose three solutions: securPharm with passive radio frequency identification tags, transport containers with sensor nodes, and an SCV dashboard. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a PSC in Germany and is therefore not intended to be exhaustive. Thus, the results serve as a foundation for further analyses. Practical implications: This study provides an overview of the functionality of Auto-ID technologies. In juxtaposition with the influence of the GDP guideline, the use of our Auto-ID-based solutions can help to enhance SCV.

Methodology/approach: Qualitative research is conducted to examine technology-related vendor selection criteria of food retailers in 5 European countries comparing to those in the US. Findings: Our findings show that global food retailers view supply-chain technology as a competitive advantage and is integrated as an important selection criteria; however, selection criteria differ for food-production technology between the United States and the European countries. European food retailers explicitly oppose food-production technology (GMO), while U.S. food retailers implicitly accept food-production technology. Emerging from this opposing view, global food retailers establish similar criteria for organic food (non-GMO) supplier selection: reliability, distance, consistent quality, and relationships with suppliers. Research implications: Applying the supplier choice criteria framework (Lehmann and O'Shaughnessy 1982) to further analyze organic food suppliers, we find that reliability (adaptive criterion), distance (integrative criterion), consistent quality (performance criterion), and relationships with suppliers (economic criterion) are essential, but price is not. Practical implications: This study suggests that to sustain competitiveness in the global food market, food suppliers not only need to ensure technological compatibility in supply-chain, but also adapt to the local food-production restriction (GMO) and organic food selection criteria preferences. Originality/value/contribution: Supply-chain technology is strategically important and is adopted by global food retailers for competitive advantage; yet, there are dramatic differences regarding the acceptance of food production technology.

The empirical research presented in this paper goes beyond existing material in this field, which remains mostly conceptual, qualitative or descriptive, by targeting statistical generalisation, using findings from a multi-annual survey of transport and logistics service operations in the supply chain. Findings show that existing operational arrangements of transport and logistics service providers mostly remain limited to traditional transport and warehouse services but that technology proves an answer to achieving the targeted expansion of third party operations.

The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

We develop conceptualizations of veracity and timeliness appropriate to the SEA context. We also link veracity and timeliness to key steps in the auditing process (data collection, recording and sharing, and analysis and interpretation) and explore technology's role in these steps. We then contrast the traditional audit process to a technology-enhanced audit process and develop an organizing framework to generate a research agenda linking technology-enhanced auditing to veracity and timeliness of the audit process, and, in turn, enhancing social and environmental supply chain performance. The novelty and value of our work lie in its exploration of how technology-enhanced auditing relates to (1) issues related to scope/focus, firm motivations for SEA, and governance of the audit function, (2) three conditions under which the benefits of technology-enhanced audits are most likely, (3) the 4 V's of data (volume, variety, velocity/timeliness and veracity); and (4) possible mechanisms by which veracity and timeliness affect social and environmental performance in the supply chain."

The goal of this paper is to identify boundary conditions for sharing assurance information to improve traceability. Four cases in the food supply chain have been investigated using a template analysis of 16 interviews. Eighteen boundary conditions categorized in business, regulation, quality and traceability categories have been identified. Some boundary conditions were found in all supply chains, whereas others were found to be supply chain specific. Standardization of traceability processes and interfaces, having a joint platform and independent governance were found to be key boundary conditions before blockchain can be used.

The capacity that the operator installs in one period also remains available in subsequent periods. The operator can increase or decrease the available capacity at each period. For this model, an algorithm to find the centralized optimal solution is proposed. A profit sharing contract where firms share both the revenue and operating costs generated throughout the periods along with initial technology investment is suggested. Also a coordinating quantity discount contract where the discount on the price depends on the total installed capacity is designed. The case where the vendor decides on the technology investment level and the operator decides on the capacity of the network is also analyzed and it is shown that this game has a unique Nash equilibrium. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, technology that is adopted by many firms in an industry can shift the basic supply relationship, increasing total production while lowering farm prices. While generally beneficial to consumers, this result can reduce (or completely offset) benefits for farmers, especially late or non-adopters. Our objective is to assess the market dynamics of alternative assumptions about exogenous productivity-enhancing technology adoption by Brazilian dairy farms. Of particular interest is the distributional impact on farm incomes and on the proportion of milk production for different farm size classes. To achieve this objective, we developed an empirical System Dynamics model that evaluates market and farm profitability impacts from 2006 to 2016. We simulated six counterfactual scenarios comprising three rates of adoption (slow, medium and fast) by two farm size categories (small and large). Technology adoption impact differs in the short- and long-term and depending on the assumed rates and farm sizes. Non-adopters of technology can experience lower incomes and a smaller production and income shares when other farms adopt. The underlying causal structure of farm profitability and the herd management decisions suffices to explain the potential market exclusion of non-adopting farms (especially small-scale farms) when others adopt."

Our analyses reveal several interesting results. First, it is beneficial for the innovator to license to the entrant, even for free, when the relative quality of the low-end product provided by the latter is moderate. Second, when the network effects are weak and the quality of the low-end product to introduce is high, the innovator prefers the internal commercialization strategies, while the supplier and the consumers prefer the external commercialization strategy. Third, if licensing fees can be collected, the fixed-fee licensing contract dominates the royalty licensing contract when network effects are strong, or when the entrant is relatively weak. In addition, in the extended models, we point out that our key findings and insights are relatively robust with respect to the market structure in the upstream of the supply chain (monopolistic versus competitive) or the cost structure of the differentiated final products (homogeneous or heterogeneous), but they are somewhat different under alternative wholesale price mechanisms (uniform versus discriminatory)."

These include changes in connectivity and access from standalone computing to pervasive ubiquitous computing, wired to wireless connectivity, 24×7 information availability in smart devices, interactive and customizable social network web pages, abundance instant information and self-organizing networks. In terms of decision making, access to the required information is very limited earlier because of the existence of complex models and limited resources to find solutions.

The data were collected through a semistructured questionnaire with a sample consisting of 160 Brazilian chemical companies. Processed by structural equation modeling, it generated an empirical theoretical model composed of three main constructs: technology, green supply chain management and environmental performance. Findings: The application of the theoretical empirical model revealed that the technology partially mediates the relationship between green supply chain management and the environmental performance of Brazilian chemical companies.

As the world attempts to navigate through this difficult time, most companies are struggling to maintain a steady flow of required goods and services. Whether it is frozen foods and grocery items (i.e., toilet papers), or ventilators and masks, or even the services (i.e., clinic visits), the supply chain has been facing multiple obstacles. Most models and frameworks built in the extant literature are not been able to capture these disruptions and as such, firms are not having proper strategies to deal with. For firms with complex supply chains (i.e., manufacturing, retailing), it is indeed critical to identify strategies to deal with such a crisis. In this paper, we intend to offer strategic insights in terms of major issues firms are facing and strategic options firms are contemplating. We rely on the twitter data from NASDAQ 100 firms to generate themes regarding the issues faced by the firms and the strategies they are adopting using text analytics tools. We find that firms are facing challenges in terms of demand-supply mismatch, technology, and development of a resilient supply chain. Moreover, moving beyond profitability, firms are experiencing difficulties to construct a sustainable supply chain. We provide futuristic strategic recommendations for the rebuilding of the supply chain."

However, little is known about how the alignment between information technology and supply chain practice impacts business performance. This paper investigates two supply chain practices (i.e. sourcing practice and delivery practice) and information quality. Scales measuring sourcing practice, delivery practice, and information quality were developed. Four strategic clusters of companies, using alternative supply chain strategies, are identified. In three of the strategic clusters, the level of supply chain practice is consistent with the level of information quality. The fourth strategic cluster has a high level of information quality but a low level of effective supply chain practices. In this study, the fourth strategic cluster performed consistently worse than the other three strategic clusters. The performance measures consist of sales revenue and profitability. This study shows that firms need to align supply chain practice with the level of their information quality in order to achieve good overall business performance.

Simultaneously, the moderating effects of uncertainty and the degree of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance are also estimated. The analytical results indicated that proactive technological orientation, information technology (IT) connectivity, supply chain member pressure, and member relationship quality encourage firms to combine their business systems with those of other business partners. Interestingly, in a situation where there is high demand and an uncertain supply, the impact of BSL on supply chain performance is low, while the moderating effect of process innovation on the relationship between BSL and supply chain performance is significant. Finally, it is suggested that firms implementing BSL work to upgrade their technology maintain tight relationships with supply chain partners and create innovation in all aspects of their business processes in order to survive in the highly competitive IT environment."

The supplier in our model has private information about its limited capacity. We compare two models of information. In the first, the supplier observes capacity and reports the capacity to the purchaser in exchange for a purchase commitment. We designate this contract as the “Supply Chain” contract. In the second, the purchaser is directly linked to the supplier's ERP system using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This linkage avoids information asymmetry. We refer to this contract as the“Full Information” contract. While the Full Information contract is economically more efficient, the supplier would be reticent to agree to this contract. We propose a third contract, which we call the “Hybrid” contract, that awards the purchaser the efficiency gains available in the Full Information contract, but which provides the supplier the same profits as in the Supply Chain contract. The purchaser, however, would still prefer the Full Information contract to the Hybrid contract. We then add an additional dimension to the problem by allowing the supplier to invest in capacity. We find that due to the increased investment under the Hybrid contract, the purchaser may actually prefer the Hybrid contract to the Full Information contract-as long as the information asymmetry is not too great."

Will a manufacturer use more or fewer suppliers due to the increasing use of IT? Based on data from a sample of 150 U. S. manufacturers, we find no direct relationship between e-procurement and number of suppliers at the aggregate level. However, when we distinguish the type of goods purchased, we find that the use of electronic procurement is associated with buying from more suppliers for custom goods but from fewer suppliers for standard (or commodity) goods. It is possible that for commodity goods, an efficiently functioning transparent market ensures that a few suppliers are sufficient, whereas for custom goods the need for protection from opportunistic vendor holdup leads to the use of more suppliers. Further, the positive relationship between number of suppliers and electronic procurement for custom goods is negatively moderated by deeper buyer-supplier system integration. This implies that such integration can help buyers obtain better ""fit"" for their customized requirements, an alternative to increasing fit by employing more suppliers as proposed in the extant literature. © 2008 M.E.

The study is quantitative in nature. Primary data of 350 managers were analyzed. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to examine the hypotheses. Empirical findings overall supported the TOE framework and Diffusion of Innovation theory. Analysis of perceived factors suggested that technological, organizational and environmental factors may influence on adaptation of RFID in successful SCM systems. Moreover, in-depth analysis shows that explicitness of RFID technology, encouragement for innovation, and environmental uncertainly are significant and positive predictors of adaptation of RFID. This research contributes empirical findings to help managers of large scale firms to consider studied factors in adaptation of RFID technology in their firm. Since very few firms have implemented RFID in supply chain process. Hence this study provides them a holistic picture which helps them in formulating a concrete strategy."

However, at present, the implications of vertical strategic interactions for green technology investment in a supply chain are not all that clear. In particular, such a vertical interaction not only can translate into profits between different parties, but usually also involves differentiated environmental performance. A question which arises is: who is the right undertaker for green technology investment in a supply chain, the supplier or retailer? To answer this question, we highlight the implications of vertical strategic interaction for green technology investment in a supply chain. To fill this gap, using a game-theoretic approach, we formulate two models: (a) Model M, in which an upstream manufacturer adopts technologies to meet consumer demand; and (b) Model R, where a retailer integrates environmental concerns into their supply chain decisions. We find that the retailer, who is closer to the customer, is the more effective undertaker for green technology investment, as this not only creates higher profitability for both parties, but also achieves a more sustainable scheme for our environment. When green technologies are invested in by the manufacturer, the double marginalization effect not only may downward-distort their economic performance but can also reduce the equilibrium of product greenness."

The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).

In most business scenarios, the supply chain network is becoming one of the most vital focusing areas. In the supply chain network, blockchain technology is a promising solution for secure information sharing. However, it is a bit critical in maintaining security at each level of the blockchain and hence the public–private–key cryptography is more commonly preferred. This study intends to construct a new privacy preservation model in the field of supply chain networks based on blockchain technology by undergoing three major phases, namely, (a) data sanitization, (b) key generation, and (c) restoration. Further, the sensitive fields in the original data are selected during the data sanitization phase, and in the key generation phase; the optimal key is generated to hide the selected sensitive fields. The hidden data with the secured key is transferred from the source (manufacturer) to destination (vendor) in the supply chain network via the blockchain. The restoration process takes place in the receiver side with the help of the same key. Among all these data flow methods, the optimal key selection is the critical issue that needs to be overridden to make the data transmission secured. As a novelty, a new optimization algorithm referred to as Whale with New Crosspoint-based Update (WNU), which is the advanced version of Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), is developed here to select the optimal key. Finally, the proposed WNU model is analyzed in terms of Hiding Failure (HF) rate, Information Preservation (IP) Rate, and False Rule generation (FR), and Degree of Modification (DM).

Prior studies that analyzed the impact of IT on supply chain performance report results representing the situation of the “average industry.” This research focuses on the automotive industry because of its major importance in many national economies and due to the fact that automotive supply chains do not represent the supply chain of the average industry. Design/methodology/approach: A research model is proposed to examine the relationships between IT capabilities, supply chain capabilities, and supplier performance. The model divides IT capabilities into functional and data capabilities, and supply chain capabilities into internal process excellence and information sharing. Data have been collected from 343 automotive first-tier suppliers. Structural equation modeling with partial least squares is used to analyze the data. Findings: The results suggest that functional capabilities have the greatest impact on internal process excellence, which in turn enhances supplier performance. However, frequent and adequate information sharing also contributes significantly to supplier performance. Data capabilities enable supply chain capabilities through their positive impact on functional capabilities. Practical implications: The findings will help managers to understand the effect of IT implementation on company performance and to decide whether to invest in the expansion of IT capacities.

Yet, there is no adequate understanding of how spillover and cooperation can impact the enterprises' green innovation decisions in the presence of free-rider. Besides, the dynamic impact of green innovation on emission is still lack of attention. We develop a differential game model that explicitly considers a supply chain with two types of manufacturers (i.e., green innovation and free-riding) to examine the dynamics of green innovation. The analysis reveals that under the noncooperation mode, the emissions and profits of free-riding manufacturers are found to be lower than that of innovating manufacturers, but technology spillovers will narrow the gap between them. Under the cooperation mode, there would be greater innovation efforts of green manufacturers and lesser efforts of green suppliers. Moreover, technology spillovers will have less impact on optimal decision changes. The profit of free-riding manufacturers is higher than that of innovating manufacturers, but the initial market power will affect the changes in their sales and profits. Meanwhile, cooperation will increase the total emission amount and long-term profits of the green supply chain, and technology spillovers of green manufacturers will help narrow the emission gap and broaden the profit gap, while that of the suppliers will have the opposite effect.

For analyzing the results, Smart PLS software 3 was used by employing the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The direct effect findings of the study show that supply chain information technology capability (SCIN), supply chain relational capability (SCRC)and supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDC) have a significant and positive association with the supply chain organizational performance (SCOP) of the pharmaceutical industry of Thailand. On the other hand, the indirect findings show that corporate governance (CG) is significantly moderates on the relationship of SCRC, SCDC and SCOP. Whereas, corporate governance is not significantly moderates in the relationship of SCIN and SCOP. These findings reveal that CG is considered to be a significant moderator because it has significant moderating effect in most of the exogenous variable and SCOP which shows a big contribution of the following study.

Although several studies have investigated the benefits to network leaders from these systems in various industries, little attention has been paid to the delivery of substantial benefits and advantages to its partners. Based on information technology (IT) applications and SCC literature, this paper proposes a model relating partners use of SCMS to benefits. Data from 168 partners using an SCMS implemented by a leading bicycle supply chain in Taiwan to test the hypotheses that SCC and operational performance has a mediating role linking SCMS use in order to affect a partner's performance. The results indicate that SCMS implementation has a significant impact on SCC, which in turn create a significant positive effect on operational (sustainable) performance, ultimately leading to improved growth rate and profitability in partners. Another interesting finding of the research is that SCMS cannot directly affect financial performance. In addition, from sustainable performance aspects, it is revealed that IT enables supply chain management (SCM) to achieve environmental value through information sharing (up and down), process integration (vertical and horizontal) and automation (i.e., planning, operation and control). This finding highlights the importance for maximizing benefits and sustainability for the whole supply-chain partners, the IT implementation must be integrated with the sustainable development goals and inserted in the eco-operation supply-chain platform process. The results also contribute to the debate in prior studies by disclosing why so many partners could not find to gain benefit from these IT implementations.

Moreover, providers also consider forward integration into manufacturing to monetize their intellectual property. We characterize the appropriateness of different business model decisions for markets, which may have varying levels of consumer diversity and competitive intensity at intermediate layers. For the technology provider, our key results show that a subsystem base royalty approach is the optimal business model when dealing with monopolistic intermediaries or having a low degree of consumer diversity. However, a full-system base royalty business model becomes increasingly optimal when the intermediate supply chains face competition and consumer diversity increases.

The high cost of treatment incurred due to the use of expensive imported treatment chemicals and the dependence on energy-intensive technologies leads to incompliance. In search of a sustainable option, a technology development project was undertaken at the bench-scale with the research goal of developing an appropriate method of pre-treating textile wastewater using locally available chemicals and materials. The process involved chemical oxidation using Calcium hypochlorite followed by waste iron filings aided rapid sand filtration to remove residual OCl− ions and suspended residue from reduced calcium hypochlorite. Complete removal of the color and over ninety-five percent removal of chemical oxygen demand was achieved. Reducing the chemical oxygen demand calls for reduced loading to the downstream biological treatment system thereby reducing aeration requirement and thus energy consumption.

The authors studied seven large U.S. corporations that are exploring how blockchain might improve their supply chain operations. Their early initiatives show that the technology can enable faster and more cost-efficient product delivery, make products more traceable, streamline the financing process, and enhance coordination among buyers, suppliers, and banks. There are special requirements for using blockchain in supply chain management: restricting participation to known, trusted partners; adopting a new consensus protocol; and taking steps to keep errors and counterfeits out of the supply chain.

The growing number of issues related to food safety and contamination risks has established an immense need for effective traceability solution that acts as an essential quality management tool ensuring adequate safety of products in the agricultural supply chain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can provide an innovative solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. Today's agricultural supply chains are complex ecosystem involving several stakeholders making it cumbersome to validate several important criteria such as country of origin, stages in crop development, conformance to quality standards, and monitor yields. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts efficiently perform business transactions for soybean tracking and traceability across the agricultural supply chain. Our proposed solution eliminates the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transactions records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security. The proposed solution focuses on the utilization of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions among all the participants involved within the supply chain ecosystem. All transactions are recorded and stored in the blockchain's immutable ledger with links to a decentralized file system (IPFS) and thus providing to all a high level of transparency and traceability into the supply chain ecosystem in a secure, trusted, reliable, and efficient manner."

Moreover, the paper analyzes the extent that economic obstacles may cause young small and medium-sized firms to choose different adoptions. Our analysis shows that exporting firms do not tend to conduct embodied backward/forward adoptions, but more likely adopt the embodied backward purchasing. In addition, the impact of competitiveness follows an inverse U-shaped pattern for the embodied backward adoption, but a U-shaped pattern for the disembodied adoption. In terms of market power, there exists an inversed U-shaped pattern for the embodied backward adoption. Under the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) linkages and vertical spillovers, it is found that technology transfer through backward/forward linkages is associated with the embodied ones, whereas a linkage with FDI domestic customers/suppliers is less likely associated with the embodied ones. In addition, under technology transfer, firms facing economic constraints may overcome these by looking for other financial sources and embodied technology transfer.

This work investigates a lignocellulosic biorefinery concept integrated with forest industry, focusing on how different economic conditions affect the preferred supply chain configurations. The technology investigated is black liquor gasification, with and without the addition of pyrolysis liquids to increase production capacity. Primarily, it analyses trade-offs between high biomass conversion efficiency and economy of scale effects, as well as the selection of centralised vs. decentralised supply chain configurations. The results show the economic advantage for biomass efficient configurations, when the biorefinery investment is benefited from an alternative investment credit due to the replacement of current capital-intensive equipment at the host industry. However, the investment credit received heavily influenced the cost of the biorefinery and clearly illustrates the benefit for industrial integration to reduce the cost of biorefineries. There is a benefit for a decentralised supply chain configuration under very high biomass competition. However, for lower biomass competition, site-specific conditions will impact the favourability of either centralised or decentralised supply chain configurations."

Closed-loop supply chains are part of green supply chain management and include traditional forward supply-chain activities as well as additional activities of the reverse supply chain. Extant supply chain literature calls for a chain perspective in order to avoid sub-optimization in the chain since changes at one stage can affect the performance at other stages. The purpose of the paper is to analyze how implementation of green supply chain innovations can enhance value offerings along the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an explorative, single-embedded case study of a food supply chain. The case is concerned with implementation of green supply chain innovation in terms of biogas technology. The single case comprises four actors in the food supply chain: a retailer, an industrial bakery, a mill, and a farmer. Data collection is based on semi-structured interviews with persons responsible for sustainability in the respective companies. Findings: The case demonstrates that in order to reach the full potential of a green supply chain innovation, the different supply chain actors must be included. What in isolation of one company's perspective is perceived as a waste can be transformed to a value when the problem area is analysed from a chain perspective. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on a single case study that does not provide static generalizations, and it represents the first step on a road to building new theory about green supply chain innovations. Future research can expand the findings by elaborating upon cases of other types of supply chains and supply chain innovations. Practical implications: The perception of waste in a supply chain can be changed through green supply chain innovations. This case illustrates how obsolete food products at the retail level, which traditionally have been perceived as a waste product with related discarding costs, can be regarded as a valued input by implementation of biogas technology at the industrial bakery company. As a result, other food supply chains can investigate similar solutions. Originality/value: The paper provides a case that visualizes how value offerings along a food supply chain can be chased through green supply chain innovations. Furthermore, the paper applies a supply chain perspective not only conceptually but also empirically. By focusing on the interfaces between each main actor in the supply chain, this paper contributes to existing research with valuable knowledge of inter-organizational issues related to challenges of supply chain innovation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Design/methodology/approach - Based on the relevant literature, this paper analyses the adoption of UCT in SCM operations, and describes the series of shaping processes. These processes are influenced largely by management and technical factors such as strong support from top management and by convenient user interfaces in global ubiquitous computing settings. These two factor types (management and technical) support the formulation of a theoretical framework that can be examined in two national environments (UK and Korea). Findings - The results highlight the key differences in terms of UCT adoption in supply chain contexts between the two national environments examined, and indicate that these differences are affected by the different national industrial foundations, organizational network infrastructures, and perspectives on system development, as well as by issues related to the costs and practical benefits of using this technology in SCM. Practical implications - This study raises some major implications for researchers and practitioners alike. Specifically, the paper stresses the role of management and technical issues in terms of UCT adoption in SCM operations, and expands current theoretical understanding of the subject. It also provides a set of management implications, including the need for managers to have strong support from top management and the need for a convenient user interface.

Economic modeling investigated the operational and organizational management of hospital supplies across procedural and nursing care areas for two scenarios; (1) manual or no technology to automated supply management technology and (2) automated technology optimized with RFID (UHF) capabilities. Methods: A literature analysis was performed using PubMed and Google from 2008 to 2018 with 38 relevant articles identified. Hospital supplies are managed and, or reimbursed differently, therefore five clinical settings were defined and modeled separately; operating room (OR), cardiac catheter lab (CCL), interventional radiology (RAD), emergency department (ED) and all other nursing care areas (NCAs). An average 300-bed hospital facility was estimated to have (10) OR suites, (2) CCL, (1) RAD, (1) ED and other NCAs. Technology acquisition and hospital implementation costs were also included for this analysis. The following benefits ranges were modeled; 3 - 10% utilization reduction on supply spend, 25% range of average missed changes captured to realize billable revenue and a one-time on-hand inventory optimization (10-12%). Data inputs came from literature, Definitive Healthcare, American Hospital Directory (reimbursement payer mix), and real-world practice engagements. Results: Total hospital-system supply expenses estimated for the base-case was $23.9M and $1.9B annual revenue. Scenario 1 (automation adoption) resulted in $3.45M annual benefit. Technology adoption costs estimated at $290K/year. ROI break-even point at 6 months. Scenario 2 (RFID optimization) resulted in $1.34M annual benefit. Additional technology adoption costs estimated at $36K/year. ROI break-even point was 7 months. Conclusions: Hospital supply expenses represent significant costs for hospital systems, and supply management, from procurement to reimbursement, is complex. Hospital systems may engage a multi-year journey to adopt best practices, policies and technology requiring subsequently optimization at the device, staff or data management level to fully realize expected benefits."

The paper studies strategic decisions of the channel members in a decentralized and centralized structure and extends this to decision making under contractual settings. Findings: A two-part tariff completely coordinates the green supply chain, while a cost sharing and revenue sharing contract only achieve partial coordination. Nevertheless, a cost sharing, as well as a revenue sharing contract, increases the greening and technological adoption effort by the manufacturer while yielding the supply chain members a strictly larger profit. Furthermore, a revenue sharing contract in comparison to a cost sharing contract, leads to a larger greening and technological adoption effort by the manufacturer, lower wholesale and retail prices and a strictly larger profit for both the manufacturer and the retailer. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the green supply chain pricing, technology and contract literature considering strategic interactions between a manufacturer and retailer in a supply chain under price premium effects of greening activities and technological advancements."

However, the extent to which GSCM pressures influence GSCM practices, and whether and how GSCM practices affect GSCM performance are topics that remain under-explored. Combining Institutional Theory, Resource-Based View (RBV) Theory, and the literature on GSCM, our study sheds light on the relationship among GSCM pressures, practices, and performance under the moderating effect of quick response (QR) technology. Using statistical analysis of the collected data and case studies from companies in China, we establish several results. First, among different GSCM pressures, market and export pressures have significant impacts on GSCM practices, whereas cost pressure does not influence GSCM practices significantly. Second, internal improvement practice exerts a significant impact on GSCM practices, while external improvement practice negatively affects positive economic performance. In addition, ecology practice has significantly influenced environmental, positive economic, and operational performance. Third, QR technology suppresses the positive effect between internal improvement practice and negative economic performance. Two real cases from Huawei (telecommunications technologies) and Beijing Benz Automotive (automobile manufacturing) are conducted to verify the findings and generate additional insights. Our findings contribute to the literature and provide guidance to help governments and companies establish effective and innovative GSCM policies."

However, it is hard for these isolated systems to work together and provide a global view of the status of the highly distributed supply chain system. Using emerging decentralized ledger/blockchain technology, which is a special type of distributed system in essence, to build supply chain management system is a promising direction to go. Decentralized ledger usually suffers from low performance and lack of capability to protect information stored on the ledger. To overcome these challenges, we propose CoC (supply chain on blockchain), a novel supply chain management system based on a hybrid decentralized ledger with a novel two-step block construction mechanism.

In this paper, we consider a closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a distributor and a third party, who are engaged in producing remanufactured products. Additionally, the manufacturer as the channel leader tends to cooperate with the distributor and the third party by technology licensing. Specifically, we develop three hybrid remanufacturing models: (1) the manufacturer collects and remanufactures used products by herself (Model M), (2) the manufacturer remanufactures a fraction of used products and licenses the distributor to remanufacture while the distributor collects used products (Model MD), (3) the manufacturer remanufactures a fraction of used products and licenses the third party to remanufacture while the third party collects used products (Model MT). We discuss the impacts of remanufacturing ability on the chain members and environmental sustainability, and also analyze the role of saving unit cost in the remanufacturing process. Moreover, we apply the Stackelberg game to attain the equilibrium strategies from the perspective of chain members' profits. The profit of the manufacturer, the distributor and the third party reaches the most in Model M, Model MD and Model MT, respectively. These results can help achieve an optimal approach of hybrid remanufacturing in a closed-loop supply chain."

It typically utilizes corn grain as feedstock in bio-refineries in many countries such as the United States. However, the use of edible matter of crops like corn may lead to a food-versus-fuel competition. To address such an issue, second generation biofuel manufacturing technology using the non-edible matter of crops has been developed. In this paper, the economic viability and environmental sustainability are analyzed and quantified, when restructuring the biofuel supply chain from employing first generation manufacturing technology to the one utilizing second generation technology considering the existing supply chain infrastructure. Two supply chain restructuring strategies, i.e., distributed and centralized preprocessing deployment, are modeled for implementing biomass preprocessing for second generation biofuel manufacturing. Bi-objective optimization formulations for the corn stover-sourced biofuel (a typical second generation biofuel) supply chain considering both economic and environmental aspects are proposed under both strategies. Different decision variables such as the locations selected for constructing preprocessing centers and the corresponding corn stover handling capacities of such centers, as well as the material flows between farms, preprocessing centers, and bio-refinery plants are identified. A case study based on the state of Missouri in the United States is implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and analyze the performance of different strategies. The results of the case study show that when corn stover is used as feedstock in bio-refineries, the unit cost of bioethanol production can be reduced, while the unit emission is increased compared to the corn-sourced supply chain under both supply chain restructuring strategies. Specifically, in Missouri where the daily stover handling amount per bio-refinery plant is relatively low and the stover collection radius is relatively small, the centralized strategy outperforms the distributed one with a higher cost reduction and a smaller increase in emissions. It reduces the unit cost by 27.39%, while increasing the unit emission by 24.42%, compared to the corn-sourced supply chain."

Cognitive mapping and narrative analysis were deployed as the two main data analysis techniques to aid our understanding and evaluation of people's cognitive complexity in making sense of blockchain technology. We found that individual experts developed different cognitive structures within their own sensemaking processes. After merging individual cognitive maps into a strategic map, we identified several themes and central concepts that then allowed us to explore potential answers to the three RQs. Our study is among the very few to date to explicitly explore how blockchains may transform supply chain practices. Using the sensemaking approach afforded a deeper understanding of how senior executives diagnose the symptoms evident from blockchains and develop assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the technology, which will then shape their future actions regarding its utilisation. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensemaking theory as an alternative lens in investigating contemporary supply chain phenomena such as blockchains.

In today’s Mach speed business environment, managers often install new technology and expect an agile supply chain when they press. This study reveals the naivety of such an approach, which has allowed new technology to be governed by old processes. Design/methodology/approach: This work takes a qualitative approach to the dynamic conditions surrounding information processing and its connection to supply chain agility through the assessment of 60 exemplar cases. The situational conditions that have created the divide between information processing and supply chain agility are studied. Findings: The agility adaptation typology (AAT) defining three types of adaptations and their mediating constructs is presented. Type 1: information processing, is generally an exercise in synchronization that can be used to support assimilation. Type 2: demand sensing, is where companies are able to incorporate real-time data into everyday processes to better understand demand and move toward a real-time environment. Type 3: supply chain agility, requires fundamentally new thinking in the areas of transformation, mindset and culture. Originality/value: This work describes the reality of today’s struggle to achieve supply chain agility, providing guidelines and testable propositions, and at the same time, avoids “ivory tower prescriptions,” which exclude the real world details from the research process (Meredith, 1993). By including the messy real world details, while difficult to understand and explain, the authors are able to make strides in the AAT toward theory that explains and guides the manager’s everyday reality with all of its messy real world details."

Using data from 205 plants, which were collected in conjunction with the High Performance Manufacturing project, the degree of supplier and customer integration and its match with the implemented IT instruments supporting interorganizational collaboration are investigated empirically. Different types of integration are differentiated from each other with the help of factor, percentile and cluster analyses. The focus and degree of IT integration is measured for each of the resulting groups and the alignment of both aspects is analyzed with the help of an approach referred to as the angles of integration. With respect to supply chain integration and IT implementation, the analysis of different integration strategies shows that most of the plants do not align their IT implementation with their supply chain strategy. The paper helps companies to evaluate the alignment of their use of IT techniques with their global supply chain management emphases. Additionally, possible reasons for a potential missmatch of functional strategies are discussed giving managers insights for dealing more effectively with a strategic alignment. Furthermore, it refines an existing framework for the comparison of different supply chain integration strategies and applies it with IT. Based on the angles of integration, the match of supply chain integration and IT is investigated by statistical analyses. © 2010 Institute for Supply Management, Inc."

However, the pathway to biofuel industry maturity faces unique, unaddressed challenges. To address this challenges, this paper presents an optimization model which quantifies and controls the impact of biomass quality variability on supply chain related decisions and technology selection. We propose a two-stage stochastic programming model and associated efficient solution procedures for solving large-scale problems to (1) better represent the random nature of the biomass quality (defined by moisture and ash contents) in supply chain modeling, and (2) assess the impact of these uncertainties on the supply chain design and planning. The proposed model is then applied to a case study in the state of Tennessee. Results show that high moisture and ash contents negatively impact the unit delivery cost since poor biomass quality requires the addition of quality control activities. Experimental results indicate that supply chain cost could increase as much as 27%–31% when biomass quality is poor. We assess the impact of the biomass quality on the topological supply chain. Our case study indicates that biomass quality impacts supply chain costs; thus, it is important to consider the impact of biomass quality in supply chain design and management decisions."

Using empirical data, we find a domino effect among IT integration, supply chain flexibility, supply chain agility, and competitive business performance.

We consider the market acceptance uncertainty of key product designs. If a firm decides to implement ex post production strategy (PS), it can delay the production until the market acceptance uncertainty of its product is resolved. Otherwise, ex-ante production strategy (AS) is implemented. We find that, due to the co-opetition, PS does not always benefit either the manufacturer or the OEM, because the value of delayed production is diminished as the competitor may commit a production quantity earlier under AS. Further, firms’ decisions on production timing are dependent on the degree of market acceptance uncertainty of their products and competition intensity. We find that both firms choose PS when uncertainty is high, while only one of them chooses PS when uncertainty is moderate or low. Interestingly, when the competition is intense, the manufacturer tends to choose PS, which can benefit from both the resolved market acceptance uncertainty and OEM’s early commitment of production quantity."

By changing the parameters of this model, we actually adjust the degree of information sharing and create new supply chain configurations. Configurations are the means of responding to events or changes in supply chains in a timely manner. A complete example is used to demonstrate this methodology. We also perform simulation experiments to compare configurations and to understand the effect of information sharing on supply chain performance.

This paper mainly discusses and explores how to create the optimized cooperators and industry sets intelligently in the supply chain network. A mathematical model and a genetic algorithm solving model for cooperator selection and industry assignment in supply chain network are presented to minimize the total delivery delay loss. The mathematical model based on the line balancing technology since the supply chain network can be treated as the extension of assembly production line can be used as a foundation for further practical development in the design of supply chain network. The genetic algorithm solving model is adopted to get a satisfactory near-optimal solution with great speed. The application results in real cases show that the solving model presented by this research can quickly and effectively plan the most suitable type of the cooperators and industry sets in supply chain network. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In many manufacturing industries, technology selection still represents a challenging and not fully understood area, especially when it comes to choosing between competing technologies with similar levels of performance. The methodology employed identified two competing lamination technologies with high levels of development and mechanization: 1) full lamination/solvent type; and 2) dot lamination/solvent free. This was followed by the identification of multiple factors affecting manufacturing technology selection with respect to the supply chain, the use of analytical hierarchy process techniques, and a case study involving site visits and interviews with the senior management of a company operating in the high-functionality textiles industry. The analysis of empirical data gathered from the case study revealed how supply chain related factors are more important than those directly related to the technical merit of the technology such as low-cost manufacturing or automation. The proposed approach has the potential to be transferable to other industries using lamination processes and/or advanced fiber and fabric technology."

A proper decision-making framework and method may be conducive to bridging generic and macro-level sustainability with local-site and task-oriented technology selection, improving the application of sustainable technology. For this reason, a framework is explored to highlight the sustainable nature of relevant components during an operational decision-making process within the supply chain. With an eye to the triple bottom of sustainability, the product chain, value-added activities of supply chain and stakeholders are analyzed and embedded into the technology selection method. The dynamic relationships among these components (product chain, value-added activities and stakeholders) as carriers of technology are also discussed so as to investigate their sustainable features. Furthermore, to figure out the whole technology decision-making logic map, a modified strategic balanced scorecard is established and applied to evaluate technology candidates in terms of their features of sustainability. Next, a computing method is designed to produce a sustainable technology choice. The multilateral mechanisms among the three groups, as well as within each group, during the technology selection process are identified and elaborated completely.

Three constructs, namely, operational IS, strategic IS and infrastructural IS, have been identified from literature. Four plant-level supply chain constructs, namely, strategic supplier partnership, information sharing and information quality, purchasing management and inventory management, have been identified. The co-relation between ISs, supply chain practices and OP has been tested. Finally, both ISs and supply chain impact on OP have been evaluated. The ISs create an indirect impact on OP via supply chain practices, which results in OP. The OP can be in the form of reduction in number of defects in operations, quality improvement in products, delivery of products or raw material at right place, at right time and in right quantity. The study leads to interesting implications for practitioners. The ISs should be connected at various levels, that is, operational, strategic and infrastructural, to support the entire supply chain. With the changing dynamics of accuracy and speed in operations and the target of achieving economies of scale, the role of ISs becomes critical in the entire supply chain.

Irrigation, therefore, has a crucial role in enhancing food security and reducing hunger in the region. Numerous countries in Africa consider water and irrigation management as a key factor in improving their food security and ensuring access to drinking-water for their populations. Fortunately, there is evidence from a number of places on the continent where the adoption of efficient irrigation systems has led to higher productivity among smallholder farmers. While the appropriate interventions for the diverse agro-ecological zones of sub-Saharan Africa are known, adoption among smallholder farmers still remains a challenge. Digital technology opens the vast untapped potential for farmers, investors, and entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of food production and consumption in Africa. From precision farming to an efficient food supply chain, technology could bring major economic, social, and environmental benefits. Increasing investment and involvement of the private sector is crucial for the up-scaling of irrigation technologies. Indeed, the sheer optimism across the startup ecosystem is that extreme hunger can be cured in Africa, in this generation, by significantly transforming the industry that employs most of its citizens.

Majority of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. As a strategy to reduce child mortality, the Government of Malawi, in 2008, initiated integrated community case management allowing health surveillance assistants (HSAs) to treat sick children in communities. Malawi however, faces health infrastructure challenges, including weak supply chain systems leading to low product availability. A baseline assessment conducted in 2010 identified data visibility, transport and motivation of HSAs as challenges to continuous product availability. The project designed a mHealth tool as part of two interventions to address these challenges. Methods A mobile health (mHealth) technology - cStock, for reporting on community stock data - was designed and implemented as an integral component of Enhanced Management (EM) and Efficient Product Transport (EPT) interventions. We developed a feasibility and acceptability framework to evaluate the effectiveness and predict the likelihood of scalability and ownership of the interventions. Mixed methods were used to conduct baseline and follow up assessments in May 2010 and February 2013, respectively. Routine monitoring data on community stock level reports, from cStock, were used to analyze supply chain performance over 18-month period in the intervention groups. Results Mean stock reporting rate by HSA was 94% in EM group (n = 393) and 79% in EPT group (n = 253); mean reporting completeness was 85% and 65%, respectively. Lead time for HSA drug resupply over the 18-month period was, on average, 12.8 days in EM and 26.4 days in EPT, and mean stock out rate for 6 tracer products was significantly lower in EM compared to EPT group. Conclusions Results demonstrate that cStock was feasible and acceptable to test users in Malawi, and that based on comparison with the EPT group, the team component of the EM group was an essential pairing with cStock to achieve the best possible supply chain performance and supply reliability. Establishing multi-level teams serves to connect HSAs with decision makers at higher levels of the health system, align objectives, clarify roles and promote trust and collaboration, thereby promoting country ownership and scalability of a cStock- like system."

We first find the buyer entry can increase the incumbent buyer's incentive to conduct the technology upgrade: if the production cost is high as well as the investment cost is low in the scenario without technology spillover, he will upgrade the production technology to a higher level after the buyer entry. At such level of the upgraded technology, the incumbent buyer is better off in the market with entry, contrary to conventional belief that the entry likely hurts the existing firm. Moreover, our research reveals that upgrading the suppler's production technology can, in turn, influence the buyer entry and further the concentration of the product market. Without technology upgrade or with that but in the absence of technology spillover, the entrant buyer will be fed by the supplier, resulting in a successful entry and thereby a competitive market. However, when technology upgrade occurs along with technology spillover, supplying products to the entrant buyer will be refused by the supplier under a high production cost and a low investment cost, incurring her entry failure and thus the market monopoly."

The purpose of this paper is to suggest a pathway for closing the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to develop a more resilient supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: Based upon virtual roundtables with supply chain executives, supplemented with interviews and publicly available datapoints about COVID-19 impact on the supply chain, we explore challenges in industry and suggest opportunity areas where research can support efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Findings: During the COVID-19 crisis, participating supply chain executives are experiencing textbook supply, demand and control risks in the supply chain. They also observe a lack of preparedness, shortcomings of current response plans and the need for greater supply chain resilience. Focus areas in improving resilience mirror generic recommendations from literature and provide a rich opportunity to reduce the gap between research findings and efforts in industry. Research limitations/implications: More empirical, event-based and less conceptual research into supply chain resilience has been called for several times during the last two decades. COVID-19 provides a very rich opportunity for researchers to conduct the type of research that has been called for. This research may contribute to the structurally de-risking of supply chains. Areas of research opportunity include decision models for supply chain design that avoid overfocusing on costs only, and that consider the value of flexibility, short response times and multiple sources as well as methods for enriching supplier segmentation and evaluation models to reduce a focus on savings and payment terms only. Practical implications: Key levers for de-risking the supply chain include the need to balance global sourcing with nearshore and local sourcing, the adoption of multiple sources and a greater utilization of information technology to drive more complete and immediate information availability. Perhaps most importantly, talent management in supply chain management needs to promote a focus not just on costs, but also on resilience as well as on learning from current events to improve decision-making. Social implications: There is a great opportunity for supply chain managers to grow their contribution to society beyond risk response into the proactive reduction of risks for the future. Researchers can serve society by informing this progress with impactful research. Originality/value: This article offers initial empirical exploration of supply chain risks experienced in the context of COVID-19 and approaches considered in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Opportunities for empirical, event-based and less conceptual research that has been called for years, are identified. This research can help close the gap between supply chain resilience research and efforts in industry to improve supply chain resilience. Hopefully the research opportunities identified can inspire the flurry of research that can be expected in response to the multiple special issues planned by journals in our field."

The authors conducted exploratory case studies in two large Brazilian companies and two major suppliers, interviewing top supply chain executives. In the first case, they identified a more relational type of governance that was mainly based on the company's relationship with its suppliers which was driven by the desire to achieve a greater market share. IT investments focused on sales and operations planning projects where all systems were being integrated. In the second case, they identified transactional governance as the predominant form. This reflects the presence of a great number of suppliers, low partnership and low supply on time delivery rate. IT investments are being made to achieve more relational governance through expenditure on e-procurement and greater integration with their suppliers using ERP."

Network-DEA models using radial measures of efficiency have been used to address supply chain performance evaluation problems. However, such models applied to bank supply chains are found to have potentially three disadvantages. First, they do not consider bank supply chains’ undesirable outputs. Second, existing studies frequently omit the impact of the heterogeneity of production technologies across different bank supply chain systems. Third, Network-DEA models fail to deconstruct the latent improvement sources of performance, thus unable to support adequately decision makers’ policy targets. To address these issues, this paper proposes two alternative network-DEA models which incorporate the directional distance function (DDF) and meta-frontier methods for evaluating bank supply chain system performance. The main characteristic of the proposed models is that they take intrinsic technology-level differences between different supply chains into account. To measure the technology levels of different types of bank supply chain systems, this paper proposes a technology gap ratio (TGR) index. A case study of 16 Chinese commercial banks from 2007 to 2014 is presented to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed network-DEA models and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed TGR index to the supply chain performance evaluation problem in the bank industry. Empirical results show that the deposit/loan efficiency of Chinese banks is still relatively low. The managerial and technological factors cause Chinese banks’ deposit/loan inefficiency. Specific suggestions are also proposed for each type of banks."

We set two conditions for establishing complementarity: (i) one type of strategic integration must positively influence the adoption of another and (ii) the two types of strategic integration must exhibit a synergistic fit with respect to manufacturing plant capabilities. We test these conditions using survey results representing 224 manufacturing plants. The findings show positive complementarities between PPT integration and supplier integration with respect to quality, delivery, and process flexibility. Also, positive complementarities exist between PPT integration and customer integration with respect to quality and new product flexibility.

Specifically, we model a domestic firm's use of a selective offshore strategy (i. e., offshoring only a portion of its information technology activities) to exploit, through IT investments or contractual provisions, the foreign vendor's large, scale-driven repository of production knowledge. We illustrate the conditions under which knowledge transfers during offshoring may reduce a domestic firm's in-house production costs, leading to total cost savings in both the short term and the long term. Alternatively, when knowledge transfers are not sufficiently large, some short-lived offshoring projects may generate substantial cost savings to the domestic firm; however, long-lived offshoring projects may cause a disruption in the knowledge supply chain, resulting in substantial losses in the later stages of the project. A firm that fails to realize the costs associated with such a disruption soon enough in the project life may find itself locked into a disadvantageous offshoring agreement without any recourse. However, a domestic firm may be able to overcome a disruption in its knowledge supply chain by exploiting the learning-by-doing production knowledge generated by the foreign vendor's economies of scale. The managerial implications derived from our learning model may help guide firms as they consider the impacts of offshore contracts and knowledge management investments on firm knowledge, production costs, and coordination costs."

We present and compare the performance differences between a wholesale price contract and a consignment contract when the retailer is the Stackelberg leader and the supplier is the follower. Based on the optimal pricing and inventory decisions, an interesting observation of contract selection is that there are two critical values of inventory available rate such that when the inventory availability is less than the lower value, both the supplier and the retailer prefer a consignment contract; when the inventory availability is greater than the upper value, a wholesale price contract is their best choice; when the inventory availability is between the two values, the supplier prefers a wholesale price contract and the retailer prefers a consignment contract. Additionally, there exist threshold values of RFID tag price and sharing rate to determine the contract preference for the retailer. Furthermore, the profits of both the supplier and the retailer are independent of the RFID tag price sharing rate in a wholesale price contract, and the supplier has the incentive to invest in RFID tag cost in a consignment contract."

Its most popular application thus far is in payment system applications, e.g., bitcoin. This disruptive technology is expected to contribute significant business value to multiple industry sectors, including supply chain management (SCM), where it can provide greater visibility, accountability and trust in interorganizational business collaboration. In this article, we review some fundamental concepts of Hyperledger Fabric, one of the most mature permissioned blockchain implementations. Further, we use the context of a food supply chain to highlight key design and implementation challenges for blockchain, and provide a strategic assessment of its prospects. Our aim is to dispel misguided notions and myths about blockchain as a silver bullet for all businesses. We believe it is important to penetrate the hype to allow a more realistic understanding of this technology. Blockchain is a high-cost, high-overhead storage medium. It is viable only when its higher cost is counterbalanced by the set of benefits that are identified by a careful and thorough analysis of the business. Thus, it will be used mainly for storing important data related to interorganizational transactions among partners where trust is lacking and provenance and visibility are critical. Our paper offers enterprises a systematic way to understand the real costs and risks of blockchain adoption. The insights gained in the SCM context also apply to other areas such as financial services and healthcare that could leverage the full potential of blockchain technology."

Technological learning curves have been commonly used as a tool to understand technological change as a function of cumulative production. Traditional learning curve approaches, however, do not distinguish the direct and upstream, supply chain technological changes by which cost reductions are achieved. While recent advances in learning curves have focused on distinguishing the different physical and economic drivers of learning, forecasted technological changes have not been applied to estimate the potential changes in the environmental performance of a technology. This article illustrates how distinguishing the different effects of technological learning throughout the supply chain can help assess the changing costs, environmental impacts and natural resource implications of technologies as they develop. We propose a mathematical framework to distinguish the effects of learning on the direct inputs to a technology from the effects of learning on value added, and we incorporate those effects throughout the supply chain of a technology using a life cycle assessment (LCA) framework. An example for cadmium telluride (CdTe) photovoltaics (PV) illustrates how the proposed framework can be implemented. Results show that that life cycle GHG emissions can decrease at least 40% and costs can decrease at least 50% as cumulative production of CdTe reaches 100 GW. Technological learning in supply chain processes can further reduce emissions and costs by up to 1-2%. Lastly, we discuss the implications of using this new technological learning framework in the long-term assessment of the costs, environmental impacts and resource requirements of technologies using life-cycle assessment."

However, these studies have not explained how the IT-based supply chain achieves this superior performance. This study aims to reveal some of the mediating influences at play: the new product development (NPD) activities of product launch, product innovativeness and product development capability. Design/methodology/approach: Taking the electronics manufacturer’s perspective, this study took a resource-based view to propose that NPD activities are affected by IT advancement and that IT-based supply chain architecture is a critical resource that ultimately affects new product performance. Thus study focuses on product launch, because this is the most expensive and risky stage of NPD; product innovativeness, because it plays a substantial role in achieving a competitive advantage; and product development capability, because it leads to superior product performance. A questionnaire was used to collect data from managers of projects, products and supply chains of computer and communication electronics manufacturers; 235 valid questionnaires were returned. These data were subsequently analyzed using a variety of statistical methods. Findings: The results support that manufacturers’ IT resources enable them to enhance NPD activities effectively with their suppliers, and that NPD activities play a key role in moderating the relationship between IT-based supply chains and new product performance. Originality/value: This paper provides an empirically tested model of how IT-based supply chain architecture can lead to superior new product performance through product lean launch, product innovativeness and product development capability."

While the basic model is general, this study is motivated by several cases of inter-organizational technology adoption in supply chains. The proposed model in this study considers firms on both levels of the supply chain, namely, supplier firms and buyer firms. These individual firms' thresholds for adoption should be considered by other firms' decisions within a network, together with their own organizational attributes. The heterogeneity across the population should be allowed. That is, individual firms make a decision for adopting the technology at different times due to their different network sizes, prior beliefs, and amounts of information observed. The main finding is that this uncertainty decreases as other suppliers adopt the technology, and information about their experiences becomes available. In addition, at any given time, an estimate of the benefit to a supplier depends on the number of supplier firms and on the number of buyer firms that have already adopted the technology. Thus, we seek to capture this dependence and analyze its effect on the adoption of a new inter-organizational technology. The next step is to embed the firm-level adoption model into a population model. The model includes various types of heterogeneity in the population model to capture the factors affecting the speed of diffusion. This allows us to derive an adoption curve that is specified by the accumulated fraction of firms that have adopted the technology in or before any given period. The population model allows us to consider the effect of several strategies observed in practice and numerical experiments yielding many managerial implications in this area."

A plethora of supply chain traceability solutions based on blockchain has been proposed recently. However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked."

The problem is often described in terms of technology readiness levels, with the particular challenge relating to the stages between proof of concept and initial adoption in the factory environment. In the United Kingdom, the government has established the High Value Manufacturing Catapult, a network of manufacturing innovation centres brought together with the objective of addressing the so-called valley of death between traditional academic research and industrial needs across a broad spectrum of manufacturing process technology. This is achieved through demonstrating manufacturing technology at full scale, in factory representative environments in terms of equipment, process control and operation. This provision helps to address the key gap of full-scale pre-production capability demonstration and can be seen to de-risk investment in new manufacturing technology. This article argues that addressing this particular gap is entirely necessary but not sufficient to drive exploitation of the full potential that is available from the latest manufacturing technologies. A three-dimensional maturity-based framework is proposed, which, in addition to considerations of technology demonstration, also allows the position of the target product application in its product lifecycle and the readiness of the supply chain to receive the technology to be taken into account as success factors in the potential for industrialisation. Case study examples, both current and historical, are used to illustrate the need for such an approach in achieving future technology-enabled supply chains. In combination, this analysis introduces the basis of a more complete ‘long valley of death’ description which articulates the needs of research networks to establish a level of foundational capability ahead of specific client readiness projects in order to maximise overall pace and achieve a level of agility of delivery which is consistent with future views on digitalisation of manufacture."

Signaling through inventory being only tenable when inventory transactions are verifiable at low enough cost, we then turn our attention to how this verifiability can be achieved in practice and argue that blockchain technology could enable it more efficiently than traditional monitoring mechanisms.

Design/methodology/approach: A workshop with managers was organized to empirically explore blockchain adoption levels and focus areas in the supply chain, as well as drivers and barriers of implementation. Findings: Workshop participants reported that adoption of blockchain in the supply chain today is very limited but actively considered by many. Drivers for this consideration include achieving greater transparency and visibility, as well as, improving processes and reducing costs. Participants identify many barriers, including a lack of understanding of costs and benefits of blockchain in the supply chain. Interestingly, participants report less concern about the feasibility of the technology implying managerial consideration if progressing beyond the technology and into the potential adoption of it. As a result, participants may be moving beyond the hype surrounding blockchain and giving consideration to the many remaining questions. A working technology does not yet mean that there is a feasible supply chain adoption. As a result, it may be too early to tell whether blockchain will be a disruptive technology. This paper identifies several fruitful areas for further consideration by management and in research.

Although only offering an initial exploration, this paper uncovers progress being reported in industry and many areas where further consideration and research can help advance thinking and practice."

Specifically, the paper examines the extent to which task uncertainty, environmental uncertainty, and inter-organizational uncertainty affect intention to adopt cloud computing technology and how information processing capability may moderate these relationships. The paper uses a multiple method approach, thus examining the hypothesized model with both quantitative and qualitative methods. To begin, the paper incorporates a Delphi study as a way in which to choose a practically relevant characterization of the moderating variable, information processing capability. The authors then use a survey method and hierarchical linear regression to quantitatively test their hypotheses. Finally, the authors employ interviews to gather additional qualitative data, which they examine via use of content analysis in order to provide additional insight into the tenability of the proposed model. The quantitative analysis suggests that significant two-way interactions exist between each independent variable and the moderating variable; each of these interactions is significantly related to intention to adopt cloud computing. The qualitative results support the assertion that information processing requirements and information processing capability affect intention to adopt cloud computing. These findings support the relationships addressed in the hypothesized model and suggest that the decision to adopt cloud computing is based upon complex circumstances. This research is limited by the use of single key informants for both the quantitative and qualitative portions of the study. Nonetheless, this study enhances understanding of electronic supply chain management systems, and specifically cloud computing, through the application of organizational information processing theory. The authors’ mixed-methods approach allowed them to draw more substantive conclusions; the findings provide a theoretical and empirical foundation for future research in this area, and also suggest the use of additional theoretical perspectives.

Firstly, this study analyzes the influence of the number of manufacturing partners on the bilateral production cooperative relation between upstream and downstream manufacturers, finding that the number of manufacturing partners significantly influences bilateral cost-sharing proportion caused by “eliminating production technology differences between them.” Furthermore, we explore corresponding conditions for reaching different evolutionary stable strategy of the two parties in the game of production technology, concluding that manufacturers would not have better performance and either they have more and more or fewer and fewer manufacturing partners. Instead, there exists a critical interval in the number of manufacturing partners in which manufacturers regularly choose certain evolutionary stable strategies all the time. Finally, according to the example analysis on evolutionary stable states in the game and the sensitivity analysis on relevant parameters that affect the game relationship, it is shown that whether the “collaborate” strategy would eventually be chosen by the manufacturer was correlated negatively with its cost coefficient for eliminating production technology differences, but positively with the other party’s cost coefficient and extra profit in bilateral cooperation."

In this work, a general modeling framework conceived to steer decision-making regarding the strategic design and systematic planning of advanced biorefining supply networks is presented. The design task is formulated as a mixed integer linear program which accounts for the maximization of the supply chain profit, considering multiechelon, multiperiod, multifeedstock, and multiproduct aspects as well as spatially explicit features. The applicability of the proposed model, along with the use of a bilevel decomposition approach, are demonstrated with a case study of lignocellulose-based biorefining production systems in the South-West of Hungary. Results show the effectiveness of the tool in the decision-making regarding the systematic design of advanced biorefining SC networks. An economic analysis of different design configurations (i.e., centralized and distributed scenarios) through a holistic evaluation of the entire biobased SC, integrating technology superstructure, shows that both instances generate profitable investment decisions that could be equally trusted by the decision-maker unless regional restrictions are applied."

We use a mixed-integer programming formulation strengthened by valid but redundant constraints and apply Lagrangean relaxation to decompose the problem by echelon. Lagrangean relaxation provides a lower bound that is calculated using an interior-point cutting plane method. Feasible solutions are generated using a primal heuristic that uses the solution of the subproblems. Unlike common practice in the literature, the decomposition does not aim at getting easy subproblems, but rather at getting subproblems that preserve most of the characteristics of the original problem. Not only does this provide a sharp lower bound but also leads to a simple and efficient primal heuristic. We can afford to have relatively difficult subproblems because the interior-point cutting plane method used to solve the Lagrangean dual makes clever and selective choices of the Lagrangean multipliers leading to fewer calls to the subproblems. Computational results indicate the efficiency of the approach in providing a sharp bound and in generating feasible solutions that are of high quality."

These factors are divided into those related to the information technology itself and those related to maintaining the relationships that are important in managing supply chain linkages. Factors related to the technology fit such as return on investment, fit with users' needs, affordability of the technology and ability to secure the technology were found to be important in the use of these tools. The ability to secure SCM technologies currently appears to substitute for some level of trust from an information systems perspective. In the case of the most mature technology (i.e. EDI), the results show that trust is related to fit with user needs.

Exploring these questions can contribute knowledge to the field of operations management: how firms can employ their IT capabilities for operations and supply chain management, the impact of competitive and institutional environments on IT-based operations strategy; the relationships between IT-enabled supply chain practices and operations performance. This paper addresses these aspects by examining the factors affecting Chinese firms' adoption of IT-enabled supply chain operations and the benefits they achieve, by drawing from and integrating the resource-based and institutional theoretic perspectives. It identifies key organizational and institutional factors that influence firms' technology adoption for supply chain management. Results show that firms can benefit by incorporating the technology within their internal operations processes and by using the technology externally with partners in their supply chain trading community. The results provide evidence that firms' IT engagement for operations and supply chain management is significantly influenced by institutional factors. Association analysis was conducted to understand the potential influence of external diffusion on internal assimilation. The result supports the theoretical claim. Building on the existing literature, this study demonstrates how resource-based theory and institutional theory can provide a solid theoretical backbone for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in efforts pertaining to technology adoption for operational supply chain excellence. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Waste recovery is dependent on the creation of connections along the supply chain, so that actors with goods at risk of becoming waste can transfer them to those who may be able to use them as inputs or for their own consumption. Such waste recovery is, however, often hampered by what we call ‘circularity holes’, i.e., missing linkages between waste generators and potential receivers. A new type of actor, the digital platform organization, has recently taken on a brokerage function to bridge circularity holes, particularly in the food supply chain. Yet, extant literature has overlooked this novel type of brokerage that exploits digital technology for the transfer and recovery of discarded resources between supply chain actors. Our study investigates this actor, conceptualized as a ‘circularity broker’, and thus unites network research and circular supply chain research. Focusing on the food supply chain, we adopt an interpretive inductive theory-building approach to uncover how platform organizations foster the recovery of waste by bridging circularity holes. We identify and explicate six brokerage roles, i.e., connecting, informing, protecting, mobilizing, integrating and measuring, and discuss them in relation to extant literature, highlighting novelties compared to earlier studies.

In the present scenario, the SMEs are under huge pressure to achieve the supply chain competitive advantage and to improve operation and logistic effectiveness and, at the same time, remain tractable to the demand uncertainty and volatility in the market. To enhance the performance of supply chain in SMEs, the managers need to identify the internal as well as the external factors that affect the supply chain performance of SMEs in India. They need to understand the causal relationship of these factors. Design/methodology/approach – There may be a number of factors that are critical for achieving acceptable supply chain performance, and these factors have been identified by principal component analysis (PCA). In all, 29 factors have been identified by using PCA and the dominating 29 factors are categorized into 6 constructs, and finally, the structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology using the AMOS 4.0 program has been adopted as the primary methodology for this paper to assess the causal relationship among six constructs. Findings – In this paper, the authors analyzed the structural relations among information technology (IT), logistic effectiveness, operational effectiveness, customer relationship, supplier relationship and SCM competitive advantage. Results indicate that IT holds the key to achieve the SCM competitive advantage in SCM practices of SMEs in India. Research limitations/implications – The proposed models for enabling factors are tested in firms with a limited numbers of factors in highly competitive environment. More factors may be incorporated, which will help for a clear understanding and establishing the causal relationship among the various enabling factors. Practical implications – Although managers of Indian SMEs are aware of various enabling factors, a systematic approach is required for identifying enabling factors, and as these factors may have complex interrelation between them for analyzing supply chain performance in SMEs, it is essential that such an approach is in place. The paper presented here will help the SMEs managers in identifying the areas in which they need to focus their attention to improve SCM practices. A structural equation modelling is developed to show the complex relationship between the factors that affect the performance. In addition to that, the proposed structural equation model acts as a good guideline to improve the performance of the supply chain in India. Originality/value – The paper provides a structural equation model to develop a map of the causal relationships and magnitude among identified enabling factors."

Pharmaceutical supply chain processes have a crucial influence on medication quality and ultimate patient outcomes. When manufacturing problems arise, temperature control cannot be maintained throughout the supply chain, counterfeit medications enter the supply chain, containers are damaged or sensitive medication is improperly transported and stored, the drugs' effectiveness can be affected and this can result in serious consequences, including patient sickens or even death. In this paper, we analyze Radio Frequency Identification Technology (RFID), a technology that can improve communication of data and information, reduce counterfeiting, and enable monitoring of drug quality in pharmaceutical supply chains. The study is conducted in the context of an RFID platform implemented in Germany. The paper extends and complements previous studies by analyzing the RFID implementation and business value in an end-to-end supply chain process across multiple stakeholders in the pharmaceutical supply chain, from the manufacturer via the wholesaler to pharmacies and hospitals.

The basic model emphasizes how time on feed, feed density and biosecurity choices interact, as well as how these choices respond to (i) input prices, and (ii) attributes regarding animal productivity parameters that might be influenced by policy choices such as animal welfare strictures and restraints on use of medication. We show that ostensibly substituting inputs in protecting against animal health risks may in fact be complements, and that the model's production choices come as a complementary package. We then extend the model to endogenize the choice of animal genetics. A finding is that innovations in general infrastructure encourage herd owners to choose more feed efficient, but less hardy, animals. Higher feed conversion efficiency then induces the use of denser feed rations, accelerated finishing and greater levels of biosecurity actions at farm perimeters. Our theory provides a coherent framework for explaining associations among inputs and outcomes that are linked with confined animal agriculture. It also explains how animal protein supply chain technology adoption and performance can differ according to a region's state of infrastructure, why responses to a change in infrastructure may be large, and why public sector efforts to reduce production risk may beget private sector effort to do so."

Trust is a multidimensional intangible concept without clear agreement of what it constitutes, and its meaning get even more confused in a supply chain management (SCM) context. The purpose of this paper is to understand how applying BCT in SCM can influence trust. In the literature, there are some findings that address trust and BCT but they are very scattered, only some related to SCM but many related to financial applications. Thus, our method used is a systematic literature review, based on a conceptual framework of trust we developed. We discovered a great gap in linking trust (and related theories) to BCT applications in SCM. This paper gave insights on the reciprocal nature of trust as well as the influence of applying BCT in SCM. In current literature, trust is highly expected as a consequence for BCT if we are considering trust in the technology. At the same time, trust is highly expected to be an antecedent for applying BCT in terms of trust in SC partners represented by openness of information sharing. Important future research agenda is to enrich the results by using empirical studies."

Building on research in the areas of management information science, supply chains, and organizational innovation, this study explores the use of Web technologies for organizational SCM. Based on an extensive survey of North American organizations, it investigates the assimilation of Web technology systems into internal supply-chain functions and their external diffusion into interorganizational supply-chain networks, and also explores the relevant environmental determinants. The findings suggest that internal assimilation and external diffusion of Web technologies both significantly affect the benefits realized by SCM. Supplier interdependence and information technology (IT) intensity are important environmental factors affecting external diffusion. Organizational factors, such as centralization and formalization of the IT unit structure and high levels of managerial IT knowledge, are significant drivers of Web technology assimilation in the SCM function. © 2004 M.E.

However, it remains unclear how to build SC resilience and whether SC resilience can enhance firm performance and bring values to customers. By analyzing data collected from 206 manufacturers in China, this study empirically examines how firms implement different information technology (IT) patterns (exploitative versus explorative) with SC partners to achieve supplier and customer resilience from information processing theory, and examines the performance implications of these two dimensions of SC resilience. In addition, this study also investigates how IT ambidexterity reconciles the paradox between IT exploitation and IT exploration in enhancing SC resilience. The results show that both supplier and customer resilience could improve SC performance. To achieve the two aspects of SC resilience, only explorative use of IT with suppliers and customers have significant effects. The results also show that the ambidextrous use of IT on the customer side takes effect. The exploitative and explorative use of IT complement each other to improve customer resilience.

Now days the E-supply chain for serving food items is getting very popular because of ease and facilities provided by Food Delivery Apps (FDAs) like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats etc. Use of FDAs has caused variation in demand of food items and subsequently has caused an impact on bullwhip effect. Bullwhip effect is a supply chain phenomenon, which is defined as amplification of demand, as information in form of orders moves from lower echelon to higher echelon of supply chain. This paper attempts to explore the influence of E-supply chain on demand of food items and hence on the bullwhip effect, in food industry, in Indian context. In practice, E-supply chain causes price variations and results in poor forecasts and hence enhances bullwhip effect. But in present scenario, it has been demonstrated that the application of IT will contribute to the reduction of bullwhip effect in long run. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, it has been proved that due to better information sharing the bullwhip effect has been reduced which generally increases in case of E-supply chain."

Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a qualitative approach that relies on three sources of information: executive interviews, a review of current and emerging technology platforms and a small survey of subject matter experts in the field. Findings: The procurement analytics landscape developed in this research suggests that the authors will continue to see major shifts in the sourcing and supply chain technology environment in the next five years.

A value-driven supply chain that is coupled to the strategic priorities of the firm is the result of deliberate management action and strategic corporate investments aimed to procure, develop and configure the appropriate resources, processes and metrics that define that firm's supply chain. A framework of supply chain design is proposed that comprehends three key levels of factors critical in understanding supply chain design: influencers, design decisions and building blocks. Influencers are higher-level considerations such as the business and political environment, the business model employed, the firm's desired outcomes and the supply chain life cycle. Design decisions include the social, behavioural and physical/structural design elements that define a supply chain. Building blocks include the inventory, transportation, capacity and technology decisions that are used to implement the supply chain.

This suggests a potential for emissions reductions through improved accessibility to efficient technologies. This paper estimates an upper-bound CO2 emission mitigation potential that could theoretically be achieved by improved access to efficient technologies in industrial sectors. We develop a linear optimization framework that facilitates the exchange of sectoral production technologies based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), assuming perfect substitutability of technologies and homogeneity within economic sectors, while ignoring barriers to technological adoption and price driven adjustments. We consider the full global supply chain network and multiple upstream production inputs in addition to energy demand. In contrast to existing literature our framework allows to consider supply chain effects of technology replacements. We use our model to calculate emission reduction potentials for varying levels of access to technology. If best practice technologies were made available globally, CO2 emissions could theoretically be reduced by more than 10 gigatons (Gt). In fact, even second-tier production technologies would create significant global reduction potentials. We decompose sectoral emission reductions to identify contributions by changes in energy intensity, supply chain effects and changes in carbon intensities. Excluding the latter, we find that considering supply chain effects increases total mitigation potentials by 14%. The largest CO2 emission reduction potentials are found for a small set of developing countries."

In this research, a novel coordination mechanism based on preservation-technology investment is developed not only to decrease the amount of waste, but also to improve the profits of independent FSC members. The investigated FSC consists of a single-supplier and a single-buyer, where the market demand is sensitive to the retail price and freshness degree of products. The supplier decides on the level of preservation-technology investment and wholesale price while the buyer determines the order quantity and retail price. Accordingly, three decision-making approaches are proposed and analyzed: (1) decentralized approach where each member individually optimizes its decisions, (2) centralized approach where a unit decision-maker optimizes the FSC decisions from the whole FSC viewpoint, and (3) coordinated approach where an incentive mechanism is proposed to guarantee more profitability for the whole FSC system and its members than the decentralized approach. To this end, a new coordination contract named revenue-and-preservation-technology-investment-sharing (RPTIS) is designed to convince the FSC members to move from the locally optimum solution (i.e., decentralized approach) to the globally one (i.e., centralized approach). The proposed approaches are validated by the use of a data set obtained from a real-life case study. The results demonstrate that the proposed RPTIS mechanism is able to achieve FSC coordination and convince members to make globally optimum decisions. Moreover, the proposed mechanism not only increases the whole FSC profit along with the individual members' profit, but also significantly increases the freshness degree and surviving quantities of fresh products; thereby reducing the level of product waste."

Tracking any commodity is a tedious job and requires a lot of manual attention. The existing system uses a centralised database system to track a commodity. Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable ledger managed by a cluster of computers. The very nature of blockchain makes it suitable technology for traceability in a supply chain. Blockchain creates immutable records. Once a transaction is stored in the blockchain, it is impossible to tamper it illegally. This immutability of blockchain builds trust among the participants that conduct business in a lack of trust environment. Using consensus protocols, blockchain builds trust between the various participants. Blockchain provides traceability since immutable records are added in blockchain; it is easy to track the source of the product. This paper illustrates the Application of Blockchain in Agri-Food Supply Chain. It unfolds how blockchain technology can be integrated to an Agri Supply Chain and improves the traceability. This integration enables companies to quickly track unsafe products back to their source and see where else they have been distributed.

Prior studies show that Industry 4.0 adoption majorly influences the sustainability aspects in a supply chain network. The purpose of this paper is to identify the Industry 4.0 enablers of supply chain sustainability and further attempt to propose a research framework to bridge the theoretical gaps. Design/methodology/approach: In this research study, the authors have used a systematic literature review methodology in the field of Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain management. The list of papers was downloaded from Scopus (www.scopus.com) database. Through strict screening, only journal papers were selected for conducting the review of the literature. Findings: The review brings out some interesting findings which will be helpful for the research community. There have been limited research in the area of managing supply chain network sustainability through Industry 4.0 technologies. The authors found only 10 papers out of a total of 53 papers which emphasize on smart manufacturing, smart production system, smart warehouse management system, smart logistics and sustainability. Most of the previous research studies have ignored the social aspects of supply chain sustainability. Finally, the authors identified 13 key enablers of Industry 4.0 playing an important role in driving supply chain sustainability. Practical implications: The strategies for Industry 4.0 should be refined and detailed to develop economic and social systems that can act flexibly to sudden changes in the system. Top management must be convinced for prioritizing investment support and creating a system that can facilitate technology convergence. Managers must also act on new models of employment and frame plans to continuously improve the system. In addition, managers must focus on establishing a collaborative platform to facilitate high-tech research and developments. Finally, it is essential to develop a performance management system for monitoring all actions in the supply chain network. Originality/value: Integrating two independent subjects is the uniqueness of the current study.

This new operational practice motivates us to investigate the effects of carbon emission reduction on a supply chain with one manufacturer and two competing retailers for deteriorating products under VMI, which has not been fully studied in the existing literature. Carbon cap-and-trade regulation and investment in green technologies are used to curb carbon emissions generated by production and inventory holding in this system. To bench mark the performance of the decentralized system, an optimization model for the centralized system is formulated to show that there exists an upper bound on the profit penalty for decentralization and the carbon emissions of the centralized system may be lower than those of the decentralized system. A revenue-sharing contract is then proposed to improve the profit and emissions of the decentralized system. The results show that the supply chain can be coordinated perfectly when the demand depends on the manufacturer's green technology level and two competing retailers’ selling prices. Numerical examples with sensitivity analysis are further provided to test the robustness of the supply chain's operational decisions."

Design/methodology/approach - A triangulation method consisting of a literature review, a cross-functional mail survey, and 51 in-depth case analyses was implemented. Senior managers from purchasing, manufacturing, and logistics were targeted in the mail survey. The break down by channel category interviews is as follows: 14 retailers, 13 finished goods assemblers, 12 first-tier suppliers, three lower-tier suppliers, and nine service providers. Findings - Customer satisfaction and service is perceived as more enduring than cost savings. All managers recognize technology, information, and measurement systems as major barriers to successful supply chain collaboration. However, the people issues - such as culture, trust, aversion to change, and willingness to collaborate - are more intractable. People are the key bridge to successful collaborative innovation and should therefore not be overlooked as companies invest in supply chain enablers such as technology, information, and measurement systems. Research limitations/implications - The average mail-survey response rate was relatively low: 23.5 percent. The case study analyses were not consistent in frequency across channel functions. Although the majority of companies interviewed and surveyed were international, all surveys and interviews were managers based in the US. Practical implications - This study provides new insight into understanding the success and hindering factors of supply chain management. The extensive literature review, the cross-channel analysis, and case studies provide academics and managers a macro picture of the goals, challenges, and strategies for implementing supply chain management.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential impact of additive manufacturing improvements on the configuration of spare parts supply chains. This goal has been accomplished through scenario modeling of a real-life spare parts supply chain in the aeronautics industry. The spare parts supply chain of the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet was selected as the case study because the air-cooling ducts of the environmental control system are produced using AM technology. In total, four scenarios are investigated that vary the supply chain configurations and additive manufacturing machine specifications. The reference scenario is based on the spare parts supplier's current practice and the possible future decentralization of production and likely improvements in AM technology. Total operating cost, including downtime cost, is used to compare the scenarios. We found that using current AM technology, centralized production is clearly the preferable supply chain configuration in the case example. However, distributed spare parts production becomes practical as AM machines become less capital intensive, more autonomous and offer shorter production cycles. This investigation provides guidance for the development of additive manufacturing machines and their possible deployment in spare parts supply chains.

In this work, a software connector has been designed and developed to connect an Ethereum-like blockchain with the enterprises’ information systems to allow companies to share information with their partners with different levels of visibility and to check data authenticity, integrity and invariability over time through the blockchain, thus building trust. In order to explore the potential of deploying the blockchain in a supply chain, a simulation model has been developed to recreate the supply chain operations and integrated with the blockchain through the same software connector to carry out a scenario statistical analysis. Application results shows how blockchain technology is a convenient instrument to overcome collaboration and trust issues in a supply chain, to increase the supply chain overall performance, to minimize the negative consequences of information asymmetry over the echelons of a supply chain but also to discourage companies from any misconduct (e.g. counterfeiting data or low data accuracy)."

We propose the blockchain approach for different production allocation problems within a multi-echelon supply chain (MESC) under a carbon taxation policy. As such, we couple recent advances in digitalisation of operations with increasingly stringent regulatory environmental policies. Specifically, with lead time considerations under emission rate constraints (imposed by a carbon taxation policy), we simultaneously consider the production, distribution and inventory control decisions in a production allocation-based MESC problem. The problem is then formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model. We show that the distributed ledger-based blockchain approach minimises both total cost and carbon emissions. We then validate the feasibility of the proposed approach by comparing the results with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II).

However, the impact of 3D printing on operations and firm relationships in a supply chain is relatively unexplored in academic research. A unique aspect of 3D printers is that they can be installed at the retailer in a supply chain, a characteristic that we highlight in our paper since it enables the supply chain to be more responsive to demand. Consequently, 3D printers can be adopted by either the manufacturer or, in a more novel situation, the retailer; we analyze the equilibrium of Stackelberg games in both cases. We characterize the economic and competitive conditions where either firm adopts 3D printing, and show that under either scenario, it is possible for both firms to earn more profit than a benchmark system without 3D printing. We identify and quantify the positive benefits associated with 3D printing, for both firms in a simple supply chain, when either firm adopts this new manufacturing technology. In many cases, the scenario where the manufacturer adopts 3D printing and installs 3D printers at the retailer results in the best profit outcomes for the manufacturer. The retailer's preference, however, depends on problem parameters. Therefore, supply chain managers should carefully consider the possibility of 3D printing products in their supply chain."

The techniques they developed in their studies of the crystallization process allowed the WELS group to develop an osmotic dehydration cell attached to a Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope (CSLM). This arrangement allowed them to understand and accurately describe the mass transfer process at cellular level during osmotic dehydration. Throughout his productive scientific career Prof. Spiess coordinated several European research cooperation projects that were instrumental in the development of a European Network of Food Science/Engineering Institutions and a true “European Food Science community”."

It is shown that cooperative investment strategy benefits the manufacturer but damages the profits of the retailer and the whole supply chain. A revenue sharing and cooperative investment contract, which combines revenue sharing and cost sharing mechanisms, is thus designed to coordinate the supply chain. Numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium strategies and coordinating results on key system parameters are given to verify the effectiveness of the contract, and meanwhile get some managerial insights. The results show that only when the revenue sharing rate lies roughly between 1/2 and 3/4 can the contract perfectly coordinate the supply chain in most cases, which has an important guiding significance for the supply chain coordination of deteriorating items when considering preservation technology investment."

Agriculture accounted for about 14 per cent of the GDP and employed about 60 per cent of the country’s population. This article tries to explore the problems faced by Indian agriculture for food security in terms of inadequate infrastructure and highly inefficient supply chain in context of information technology (IT). This article examines the critical issues at each sub-system of agriculture supply chain, starting from the input to the consumer, with a view to integrating them in efficient and effective manner. As proper flow of information across the chain constitutes an integral part, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in improving supply chain efficiency in agriculture is discussed in detail. Thus, this article broadly covers some of the important aspects of agriculture supply chain in India—identification of issues at different levels in the supply chain; transformation in agriculture due to various supply chain interventions; the role of ICTs in supply chain management (SCM)—and the suggestion to improve efficiency at different levels in the supply chain. There is a wide research gap in this sector; having such potential and prospect for overall growth, not much research has been done in this field. The article concludes that ICT plays a very important role for the development and contemporary issues of agriculture; therefore, the government action must address the issue of infrastructure development to achieve the objective of food security for all."

In the present scenario, the SMEs are under huge pressure to achieve the supply chain competitive advantage and to improve operation and logistic effectiveness and, at the same time, remain tractable to the demand uncertainty and volatility in the market. To enhance the performance of supply chain in SMEs, the managers need to identify the internal as well as the external factors that affect the supply chain performance of SMEs in India. They need to understand the causal relationship of these factors. Design/methodology/approach – There may be a number of factors that are critical for achieving acceptable supply chain performance, and these factors have been identified by principal component analysis (PCA). In all, 29 factors have been identified by using PCA and the dominating 29 factors are categorized into 6 constructs, and finally, the structural equation modelling (SEM) methodology using the AMOS 4.0 program has been adopted as the primary methodology for this paper to assess the causal relationship among six constructs. Findings – In this paper, the authors analyzed the structural relations among information technology (IT), logistic effectiveness, operational effectiveness, customer relationship, supplier relationship and SCM competitive advantage. Results indicate that IT holds the key to achieve the SCM competitive advantage in SCM practices of SMEs in India. Research limitations/implications – The proposed models for enabling factors are tested in firms with a limited numbers of factors in highly competitive environment. More factors may be incorporated, which will help for a clear understanding and establishing the causal relationship among the various enabling factors. Practical implications – Although managers of Indian SMEs are aware of various enabling factors, a systematic approach is required for identifying enabling factors, and as these factors may have complex interrelation between them for analyzing supply chain performance in SMEs, it is essential that such an approach is in place. The paper presented here will help the SMEs managers in identifying the areas in which they need to focus their attention to improve SCM practices. A structural equation modelling is developed to show the complex relationship between the factors that affect the performance. In addition to that, the proposed structural equation model acts as a good guideline to improve the performance of the supply chain in India. Originality/value – The paper provides a structural equation model to develop a map of the causal relationships and magnitude among identified enabling factors."

Modeling under the standard newsvendor problem setting with a single manufacturer and a single retailer employing a revenue sharing contract, we develop analytical models for both the traditional and blockchain-supported supply chains. We derive the optimal contracting and quantity decisions in each supply chain with Nash bargaining between the manufacturer and retailer. We analytically show how the revenue sharing contract can coordinate both types of supply chains. We then compare the optimal systems performances between the two supply chains. We prove that the blockchain-supported supply chain incurs a lower level of operational risk than the traditional supply chain. We have shown that if the service fees by banks are sufficiently high, adopting blockchain technology is a mean-risk dominating policy which brings a higher expected profit and a lower risk for the supply chain and its members. For robustness checking, we examine other commonly seen supply chain contracts and alternative risk measures, and analytically reveal that the results remain valid."

Through the analysis of core enterprise credit risks in supply chain finance, by means of a 'fuzzy analytical hierarchy process' (FAHP), the paper constructs a supply chain financial credit risk evaluation system, making quantitative measurements and evaluation of core enterprise credit risk. This enables enterprises to take measures to control credit risk, thereby promoting the healthy development of supply chain finance. The examination of core enterprise supply chains suggests that a unified information file should be collected based on the core enterprise, including the operating conditions, asset status, industry status, credit record, effective information to the database, collecting related data upstream and downstream of the archives around the core enterprise, developing a data information system, electronic data information, and updating the database accurately using the latest information that might be available. Moreover, supply chain finance and modern information technology should be integrated to establish the sharing of information resources and realize the exchange of information flows, capital flows, and logistics between banks. This should reduce a variety of risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain finance."

Design/methodology/approach – This exploratory research was conducted in one retail supply chain. A multi-method approach combining a longitudinal real-life case study and a methodology integrating several steps, including a “living laboratory” strategy was used and involved all members of a product line to analyze their contributing activities and their interface with other supply chain members; the aim being to explore the impact of RFID technology on inter-and intra-organizational processes and information systems. Findings – The results provide support to the role ofRFID as enabler of better integration of timeliness and accuracy data flows into information systems, business process optimization through automation, better system-to-system communication and better inter-and-intra-organizational business process integration. Furthermore, they also validate the unique characteristics of RFID technology such as enabler of real-time multiple tags items data collection and exchange within the supply chain and the read-and-write capability that may help, for example, to reuse some RFID tags within the supply chain and therefore reduce the cost related to the purchase of the said RFID tags. Finally, the study also reveals the importance of business process renovation and complementary investments during the adoption of RFID technology, in order to achieve high level of business value from the technology.

To overcome these problems the supply chains must be more smarter. For establishing a large-scale of smart infrastructure to merge data, information, products, physical objects and all processes of supply chain, we applies the internet of things (IOT) in supply chain management (SCM) through building a smart and secure system of SCM. We have prepared a website for suppliers and managers. We tracked the flow of products at each stage in supply chain management through the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each product attached with RFID tag and scanned through RFID reader and ESP8266 at each phase of supply chain management. After scanning the tag we stores tag id in the database. All information about products will be entered by suppliers and then uploaded to managers. In our system the supplier and manager gets perfect information of the entire life cycle of goods, and this will achieve transparency of supply chain management. For assessing security criteria of proposed system of supply chain management, we also proposed a framework which integrates neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique with analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The neutrosophic Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (N-DEMATEL) technique is utilized to infer cause and effect interrelationships among criteria of smart supply chain security requirements. Depending on obtained information from (N-DEMATEL) the neutrosophic AHP is utilized to calculate weight of criteria and sub-criteria. Then the integrated framework will help researchers and practitioners to design secure system of supply chains. We presented DEMATEL and AHP in neutrosophic environment to deal effectively with vague, uncertain and incomplete information. So the proposed system of supply chain management will be able to overcome all challenges of traditional SCM and provide secure environment of SCM processes."

Based on the propagation speed, pressure, and direction, the infectious risk propagation capability and propagation energy distribution can be identified. The MPSC can be decomposed into N interactive subsystems. The infectious risks of various subsystems within the load scope should be diffused and coordinated in time.

In fact, the increasing level of connectivity is transforming supply chains, and it creates new opportunities but also new risks in the cyber space. Hence, cyber supply chain risk management (CSCRM) is emerging as a new management construct. The ultimate aim is to help organizations in understanding and improving the CSCRM process and cyber resilience in their supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This research relied on a qualitative approach based on a comparative case study analysis involving five large multinational companies with headquarters, or branches, in the UK. Findings: Results highlight the importance for CSCRM to shift the viewpoint from the traditional focus on companies’ internal information technology (IT) infrastructure, able to “firewall themselves” only, to the whole supply chain with a cross-functional approach; initiatives for CSCRM are mainly adopted to “respond” and “recover” without a well-rounded approach to supply chain resilience for a long-term capacity to adapt to changes according to an evolutionary approach. Initiatives are adopted at a firm/dyadic level, and a network perspective is missing. Research limitations/implications: This paper extends the current theory on cyber and information risks in supply chains, as a combination of supply chain risk management and resilience, and information risk management. It provides an analysis and classification of cyber and information risks, sources of risks and initiatives to managing them according to a supply chain perspective, along with an investigation of their adoption across the supply chain. It also studies how the concept of resilience has been deployed in the CSCRM process by companies. By laying the first empirical foundations of the subject, this study stimulates further research on the challenges and drivers of initiatives and coordination mechanisms for CSCRM at a supply chain network level. Practical implications: Results invite companies to break the “silos” of their activities in CSCRM, embracing the whole supply chain network for better resilience. The adoption of IT security initiatives should be combined with organisational ones and extended beyond the dyad. Where applicable, initiatives should be bi-directional to involve supply chain partners, remove the typical isolation in the CSCRM process and leverage the value of information. Decisions on investments in CSCRM should involve also supply chain managers according to a holistic approach. Originality/value: A supply chain perspective in the existing scientific contributions is missing in the management of cyber and information risk. This is one of the first empirical studies dealing with this interdisciplinary subject, focusing on risks that are now very high in the companies’ agenda, but still overlooked. It contributes to theory on information risk because it addresses cyber and information risks in massively connected supply chains through a holistic approach that includes technology, people and processes at an extended level that goes beyond the dyad."

In spite of their initiatives to achieve ASC for improving their organizational performance, barring a few large companies, the medium and small size manufacturing companies have not yet been able to adopt and design supply chains which lead to ASC. This may be due to various challenges in the process of achieving agility. Also, the published literature in this area is very scanty.

The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10-30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records.

The use of RFID in the supply chain is an emerging technology that has attracted a lot of attention in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Major retailers in various continents have given mandates to their suppliers to adopt the technology in order to continue business with them. As a result, there appears to be a shift in power dependency in the supply chain. This has had an impact on how the suppliers adopt RFID to embrace the mandates. The impact is likely to have a long term effect on current business models. Our study into the existing literature reveals three tiers of the effects of mandates. The effects are best examined by separating out the suppliers into two groups: suppliers adopting the technology under the mandates and suppliers not affected by the mandates and adopted a wait-and-see tactic.

A supply chain designed to minimize risks enables firms to establish a competitive position and provides long-term benefits to stakeholders. The SCRM system should be structured to manage both routine and extraordinary risks, such as natural disasters and major accidents. The risks should be managed both reactively, by monitoring changes in the chain, the needs of customers, technology and the strategies of suppliers and competitors, among others, to enable quick reaction to events; and proactively, to identify risks and implement actions to prevent them or minimize their impacts. The basic risk management process consists of identifying, evaluating, mitigating and controlling risks. The objective of this paper is to analyze how a carmaker identifies and manages the risk factors in its supply chain. To achieve this aim, we performed a qualitative, applied and exploratory field study of a Brazilian automaker. The data were collected by structured interviews, and the analytic hierarchy process was applied to rank the risk factors, resulting in a risk matrix that can be an instrument for making decisions by the company studied."

Highly interconnected supply chains would appear to be especially prone to these hazards. Although supply chain risk and information technology risk have been studied in isolation, little has been done to define the impact of information security on supply chain management. This exploratory investigation addresses this deficiency in the literature by defining information security risk in the context of supply chain management. It identifies, categorizes, and validates information technology threats as sources of risk in the supply chain. It then establishes a conceptual framework for further study into supply chain information security risk. Finally, it discusses the implications of information security risk in the supply chain.

The redundancies in variables often make the results become hard to be analysed and diagnosed. Therefore, principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced to reduce the redundancy of data series by converting a series of correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables known as principal components (PCs), without losing too much information. However, the optimisation of PCs is relatively difficult as PCs encompass of convex combinations of original variables. In this paper, a novel PCA aided optimisation approach is introduced to solve the multi-echelon biomass supply chain problem (i.e., technology selection and transportation design), with the consideration of economic, environmental (including various impact categories and environmental footprints) and social (including health aspect, safety aspect and job creation) dimensions. On top of that, analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is applied to determine the priority scale assigned to each objective. The model is illustrated by using a case study in Johor, Malaysia. In this case study, the original 13 variables (indicators) had been successfully reduced to less than 3 PCs. Besides, the obtained results are benchmarked with two other conventional optimisation approaches, namely weighted-sum approach and max-min aggregation approach. The results show that PCA optimisation approach can provide reliable and comparable results (degree of satisfaction of the obtained results, λSCM are greater than 70%). In addition, sensitivity analysis is conducted to analyse the effect of relative priority of each objective on the technology selection and transportation design. This research is also expected to be useful for the big data (large volumes of extensively varied data that are generated and processed at high velocity) analysis in future supply chain management."

The frame of reference intends to foster the coordination in buyer-supplier relations and eliminates existing inefficiencies in the execution of discrete SCF-instruments, such as reverse factoring and dynamic discounting. Moreover, we introduce value drivers for blockchain technology (BCT) to elaborate unique characteristics for its application in the field of SCF. While BCT is considered as one of the most disruptive enablers in financial technology (FinTech), it received only little attention within the emerging field of SCF. Therefore, the results contribute to future developments of appropriate SCF-solutions based on the newest technology innovations. 1. Introduction The relevance of working capital optimization and cost of capital reduction is highlighted by an increasing adoption of supply chain finance (SCF) instruments within industries. From a single firm perspective, it is important to optimize the financial flow by applying low-cost financing solutions (Klapper, 2006). From a broader supply chain perspective, SCF has further the ability to create a win-win situation for both, buyers and suppliers by improving liquidity and capital allocation across the value chain (Popa, 2013). Instruments as reverse factoring or dynamic discounting enable companies to optimize working capital and to smoothen financial risk. Although potential advantages of SCF solutions are already known in theory, the execution of these instruments still show inefficiencies in practice. Whereas SCF offers a wide range of techniques, blockchain technology (BCT) inheres a disruptive potential for the development, deployment, and usage of convenient business applications as well in the area of SCF. The digitization of physical supply chains received a lot of attention in recent years, but the flow of goods, information and finance are often considered as isolated streams across different functions and parties. Thus, the initiation of business processes is dependent on sequential input and manual confirmation (Zhang and Dhaliwal, 2009). Additionally, transactions involve a vast number of agents and intermediaries. High costs and complexity for large IT-systems, security flaws as well as time consuming processing are just some of the disadvantages of the operations today (Fellenz et al., 2009). According to that, weak contract institution, tax, legal systems, and regulations exacerbate effective interaction and standard procedures between supply chain partners (Klapper, 2006). Moreover, inconsistent governance structures complicate the collection of"

In this paper, we present a mutually supporting analytical model and exploratory case to study the managerial and policy issues related to quality control in food supply chain management with a focus on the Chinese dairy industry. Based on a general supply-chain model with acceptance sampling tests under uncertain product quality, we show that, depending on the sampling technology, the decentralized supply-chain structure may lead to a distortion in product quality. We also explore the effects of different pricing and regulatory options of vertical control on product quality and the distribution of the total supply-chain profit. In addition, we use an exploratory case study of the 2008 adulterated milk incident in China to investigate practical issues in ensuring product quality/safety in food supply chain management. Our analytical results and two comparative cases show that, instead of the common ""poor quality"" misperception of food products from global emerging markets, it is actually the poor vertical control strategy for managing the food supply chain quality and risk that caused the adulterated milk incident. A number of other important managerial and policy insights and implications regarding supply chain design, informational visibility, corporate social responsibility, and regulatory action in managing the global food supply chain quality and risk are also discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

Using mainly a cross-sectional approach, structured questionnaire was used to collect responses from two hundred and fifty-five employees drawn registered companies in the Kumasi Metropolis and analyzed with the help of Pearson’s correlation and structural equation modeling (SEM). Three elements of supply chain integration (company integration with suppliers, cross functional integration within a company and company integration with customers) and three elements of supply chain flexibility (adaptability, alignment and agility) were subjected to analysis. The results indicate that supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility exhibit significant correlation with firm performance. Supply chain integration and supply chain flexibility have high correlation with ‘financial performance’ followed by ‘logistic performance’ and then ‘operational performance’. Also, the results demonstrate that four supply chain integration surrogates; ‘production data integration’, ‘going after customers for feedback’, ‘periodic connection with customers’ and ‘real time search of inventory’ and two supply chain flexibility proxies specifically ‘technology’ and ‘supply network strategies’ are crucial as they exhibit the most noteworthy influence on firm performance. Results of this study offer remarkable demonstrations of the effects of integration and flexibility in enhancing performance of businesses and greater attention must be paid to those proxies of supply chain integration and flexibility that exhibited the most significant impact on firm’s performance."

Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions."

The SMEs in Indian food sector are facing different challenges, such as financial issues, lack of technical skills and investment in the business etc. In this sense, several key factors can help food SMEs in reducing wastage of farm products and lowering energy consumption for sustainable growth. Thus, this paper tries to identify and analyse key factors for Information Communication Technology (ICT) applications for a sustainable growth of SMEs in Indian food sector. Grey based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique was applied for analysis of factors. From findings, ‘Government initiatives and policies’, ‘Public-private partnership’, and ‘Encouragement to ICT service provider’ are topmost influential cause group factors. While, ‘ICT integrated effective food supply chain’, ‘Coordination between different departments’, and ‘Collaboration and strategic alliances across supply chain’ are highest influenced factors. Results suggests that ‘Government policies and initiatives’ are at the core of the efforts to upgrade food supply chain. As, Indian government is the largest customer of SMEs and controls various policy-making aspects in food sector. Therefore, government has to take steps to encourage private and foreign investments as well as promote IT service providers and business environment related economic policies to improve competitiveness of Indian food sector. This work would help managers to develop efficient ICT applications for an effective sustainable growth of SMEs in their respective food supply chains."

Access to these essential medicines is a major need in order to achieve ‘Good Health to All’. Traditionally, India has been a rural, agrarian economy where the majority of the population still live in villages. The main factors which affect the provision of good healthcare among the rural population are affordability, unavailability and average quality of drugs and other medical supplies. The availability and quality of medicines are substandard when compared to the urban population standards.To promote proper utilization of medicines, there is a need for availability and affordability of quality medicines in the presence of ‘rational drug usage’ ideology among the medical professionals and health workers. They play a vital role in imparting the knowledge of drug information to the patient community which in the long run can help in achieving the goal of health to all.

Methods Working with the Mozambique Ministry of Health, our team implemented a new process that integrated HERMES computational simulation modeling and on-the-ground implementers to evaluate and improve the Mozambique vaccine supply chain using a system-re-design that integrated new supply chain structures, information technology, equipment, personnel, and policies. Results The alternative system design raised vaccine availability (from 66% to 93% in Gaza; from 76% to 84% in Cabo Delgado) and reduced the logistics cost per dose administered (from $0.53 to $0.32 in Gaza; from $0.38 to $0.24 in Cabo Delgado) as compared to the multi-tiered system under the current EPI. The alternative system also produced higher availability at lower costs after new vaccine introductions. Since reviewing scenarios modeling deliveries every two months in the north of Gaza, the provincial directorate has decided to pilot this approach diverging from decades of policies dictating monthly deliveries. Discussion Re-design improved not only supply chain efficacy but also efficiency, important since resources to deliver vaccines are limited. The Mozambique experience and process can serve as a model for other countries during the Decade of Vaccines.

Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative analysis are undertaken via case studies drawn from food companies using semi-structured interviews. Findings: Blockchain is demonstrated as an enabler of visibility in supply chains. Applications at scale are most likely for products where the end consumer is prepared to pay the premium currently required to fund the technology, e.g. baby food. Challenges remain in four areas: trust of the technology, human error and fraud at the boundaries, governance, consumer data access and willingness to pay. Research limitations/implications: The paper shows that blockchain can be utilised as part of a system generating visibility and trust in supply chains. Research directs academic attention to issues that remain to be addressed. The challenges pertaining to the technology itself we believe to be generalisable; those specific to the food industry may not hold elsewhere. Practical implications: From live case studies, we provide empirical evidence that blockchain provides visibility of exchanges and reliable data in fully digitised supply chains. This provides provenance and guards against counterfeit goods. However, firms will need to work to gain consumer buy-in for the technology following repeated past claims of trustworthiness. Originality/value: This paper provides primary evidence from blockchain use cases “in the wild”. The exploratory case studies examine application of blockchain for supply chain visibility."

Based on the data collected from 196 organizations, multiple regression analyses are used to test the factor impacting information sharing and information quality respectively. It is found that both information sharing and information quality are influenced positively by trust in supply chain partners and shared vision between supply chain partners, but negatively by supplier uncertainty. Top management has a positive impact on information sharing but has no impact on information quality. The results also show that information sharing and information quality are not impacted by customer uncertainty, technology uncertainty, commitment of supply chain partners, and IT enablers. Moreover, a discriminant analysis reveals that supplier uncertainty, shared vision between supply chain partners and commitment of supply chain partners are the three most important factors in discriminating between the organizations with high levels of information sharing and information quality and those with low levels of information sharing and information quality. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, despite this relationship, a lack of coherence and clarity around the input of technology for ASC has impeded to portray accurately the relative importance of digitization in ASC strategies. This study provides a comprehensive and integrative review of 90 articles on ASC. By so doing, we contribute to the discussion about digitization in the supply chain in several ways. First, the paper reports descriptively and analytically how technology was addressed within the ASC literature. Second, it maps a nomological network of ASC research.

The purpose of this paper is to empirically test the role of cloud-based ERP services on the performance of an organization. Here, the performance is categorized as supply chain performance and organizational performance that comprises of financial performance and marketing performance. Contingent resource-based view (RBV) theory was used to develop a theoretical framework in which supply base complexity (SBC) acts as a moderating variable on the relationship between cloud ERP and the performance. Design/methodology/approach: Contingent RBV theory is used to explain the relationship between all identified variables in this paper. Partial least squares (PLS) based on structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to empirically test our theoretical framework. Findings: The PLS-SEM analysis of 154 respondents supports the contingent RBV theory. Six hypotheses – out of the eight hypotheses formulated in this paper – are supported by data. Research limitations/implications: Given this study was conducted in India where the potential of cloud ERP has not been fully implemented yet, the results may reflect more of perceived usefulness of this technology. The authors have attempted to understand the effect of SBC as a moderator in the relationship between cloud ERP and organizational performance which may not be the only moderator affecting this relationship among other potential moderators.

Incorporating sensors into packaging is promising, but it is challenging to achieve the required sampling volume while using food-safe sensor materials. Here, by leveraging water-based processing of silk fibroin, a platform for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in food is realized using a porous silk microneedle array; the microneedle array samples fluid from the interior of the food by capillary action, presenting the fluid to polydiacetylene-based bioinks printed on the backside of the array. Through the colorimetric response of bioink patterns, Escherichia coli contamination in fish fillets is identified within 16 h of needle injection. This response is distinct from spoilage measured via the increase in sample pH. It is also shown that the microneedles can pierce commercial food packaging, and subsequently sample fluid and present it to the sensor, enabling the adaptation of the technology downstream in food supply chains such as in stores or at home. This study highlights that regenerated structural biopolymers can serve as safe materials for food contact and sensing with robust mechanical properties and tailored chemistry."

Studies in green supply chain literature have often considered the market expansion effects of greening efforts. However, a number of other factors influence greening efforts, a critical one being the price premium effect driven by the brand building strategy of firms. A principal issue then arises as to which strategy should firms adopt and when does each greening effect benefit firms and supply chains more. We generate several insights into this important issue by developing models considering dyadic settings, competition, and cost-sharing contract. We examine strategic decisions in these channel structures and compare and contrast our results with the market expansion based models. We identify a number of counter-intuitive results, for example, a dyadic channel with high price-sensitive consumers would benefit more from the price premium effect and cost-sharing (when it focusses on building brand) than market expansion. We also conduct intra-channel and inter-channel comparison of outcomes to understand the effect of competition. Among other results, we find that in the presence of a dominant retailer and competing manufacturers, the retailer shares more greening cost with the manufacturer than the corresponding decentralized channel."

We use organizational information processing theory (OIPT) to develop hypotheses that identify the comprehensiveness of an organization's supply chain planning capabilities as an important mediator in the relationship between its supply chain integration activities and its operational performance. Further, our interpretation of OIPT suggests that an organization's usage of technology-enabled supply chain management systems (SCMS) moderates these effects. Using survey data from 445 global firms, we estimate the corresponding moderated-mediation structural model. The results indicate that usage of SCMS enables organizations to better utilize the information they gain from external integration efforts (relationships with customers and suppliers), thus improving the comprehensiveness of their supply chain planning capabilities. In contrast, the use of SCMS appears to be a partial substitute for internal integration as a driver of planning comprehensiveness. Most importantly, the results suggest that planning comprehensiveness is a significant generative means by which integration and technology investments produce superior operational performance.

With the development of technology, competition has gradually shifted from commodity-based attributes, such as cost and quality, to a supply chain's service capacity for e-commerce. Within this context, the present paper delineates how cross-border e-commerce firms can generate supply chain service capabilities that yield improvements in supply chain relationship quality to e-tailors and other platform users. Insights are derived through data collected via a multiple case study approach based on four Chinese cross-border e-commerce enterprises (OSell, Zongteng, BizArk and Linca); data were collected from 41 semi-structured interviews, field visits and secondary data. Relying on the service-dominant logic as the theoretical foundation, we identify three supply chain resources (flows related to information, logistics and finance) and their interplay as being critical for the development of supply chain service capabilities, which in turn lead to an improvement in the quality of supply chain relationships (assessed by the dimensions of trust improvement/commitment, risk mitigation, and customer satisfaction). The results offer important insights into how to best manage supply chain resources in relation to the three flows by cross-border e-commerce firms in order to foster relationship quality, an attribute that has become so critical today for competitive differentiation."

It is a relatively cheap process and can be conducted in centralized, decentralizes, or even mobile configurations. Furthermore, it does not overlap with the human food supply chain, using wastes or lignocellulosic feedstocks. In this article, a mixed integer (piece-wise) linear program (MILP) was developed to determine the optimal supply chain design and operation, under uncertainty. Rigorous process modelling and detailed economic analysis were coupled with exhaustive search of potential production locations and biomass resources in order to enhance the fidelity of the solution. The optimisation results suggest that a combination of geographically centralized pyrolysis and upgrading centres would suffice for supply chain management under deterministic conditions. However, under uncertain scenarios, it is advantageous to deploy mobile pyrolyzers to add extra flexibility to the process operation. Further analysis suggested that as the mobile pyrolyzers are commercialized and their unit price is reduced, this technology has the potential to become a key member of the biofuel supply chain."

We consider three investment scenarios, i.e., the investment is made by the manufacturer, both the retailers, or only one retailer. By investigating these scenarios, we find that the manufacturer prefers to have both the retailers make the investment. However, the retailers may prefer not to let their supply chain partner, i.e., the manufacturer, make the investment. In addition, because of the spillover effect from the competitor's investment, a free rider can improve its profit, though the improvement is insignificant. Moreover, we find that it is possible to simultaneously achieve economic and environmental optimality in the scenario in which both the retailers make the investment, whereby all supply chain members’ profits and the emission reduction are higher than those in other scenarios. Furthermore, analyzing the effects of the investment on consumers, we find that in most cases, the more eco-friendly the product is, the higher retail price the consumers must pay."

Business-to-business e-commerce is a new way of doing business. It tends to follow a ""reverse product cycle"" where process efficiency gains come first, followed by quality improvements to existing products and services, and finally the creation of new services and products appear (OECD). The e-commerce marketplace is one where strategy, expectations about others actions, and trust determine demand. For purposes of this paper, the buyers-users in this e-commerce market are retailers, wholesalers, and manufacturers who buy and sell products to and from each other. The seller is a service provider who can produce a reliable electronic logistics network that will improve communications and will speed up product flow. Using information technology in this way tends to build vertical alliances. It differs from a market discovery e-commerce (shopping sites) in that it involves an intimate relationship among market agents that lasts for more than one transaction and frequently covers several products, over multiple time periods."

Introduction According to Christopher (1998) today not the size of products and economic scale, but the supply chain management is necessarily a powerful solution to achieve a cost advantage. He believes that the supply chain is a network from upstream and downstream organizations. These organizations are involved in different processes and activities that produce value in the form of products and services on their final customers. (Christopher,1998) Moreover, we can say that today all organizations are exposed to the developments in information technology. And the application of information technology and communication are obvious in all areas of the supply chain including the communication with suppliers and production and customer relation. So the use of information technology affects on the improvement of the supply chain management. (Aghajani, 2008) This paper attempts to review the literature and previous studies, and investigates the role of information and customer relation management in the supply chain. It finally presents the importance of information technology in customer relation management and supply chain. 2.

Access to these essential medicines is a major need in order to achieve ‘Good Health to All’. Traditionally, India has been a rural, agrarian economy where the majority of the population still live in villages. The main factors which affect the provision of good healthcare among the rural population are affordability, unavailability and average quality of drugs and other medical supplies. The availability and quality of medicines are substandard when compared to the urban population standards. To promote proper utilization of medicines, there is a need for availability and affordability of quality medicines in the presence of ‘rational drug usage’ ideology among the medical professionals and health workers. They play a vital role in imparting the knowledge of drug information to the patient community which in the long run can help in achieving the goal of health to all.

One approach is to examine costs along the supply chain using technology to reduce identified costs. The purpose of this study was to identify key attributes that affect a school nutrition program's willingness to adopt technology for supply chain management (SCM). A survey design was used to gather data from the 500 school districts with the highest enrollment in the United States. An online questionnaire with a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree , 5 = strongly agree ) gathered data from school nutrition program professionals about their supply chain and information orientations and their willingness to engage in technology-enabled SCM initiatives. The response rate was 31.8%. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic traits of the respondents and their school district. Typical respondents were females, 51-60 years old, with an advanced college degree and 20 or more years of foodservice experience. On average the respondent's school nutrition program was operated by the school district (92.4%), employed fewer than 500 workers (77.3%), was financially solvent (71.5%), and did not centralize food purchasing (60.2%), production (84.7%), or delivery functions (60.2%). Respondents extensively utilized software within their departments and to exchange information with other departments in the school district, with other members of their supply chain, and also with their customers. Factor analysis identified three factors of supply chain orientation: Trust ( M = 4.40), Top Management Support (M = 2.73), and Commitment (M = 3.92). Information Management Practices ( M = 4.17) was identified for information orientation, and the average rating for Overall Information Management was 4.30. In general, respondents were willing to adopt technology for SCM initiatives (M = 3.98). Multiple regression analysis determined that supply chain orientation but not information orientation predicted a willingness to adopt technology for SCM. School nutrition personnel are well-advised to gain top management support prior to engaging in projects to implement technology for SCM initiatives and to select supply chain partners to whom they are fully committed and trust. Future research is needed to further explore SCM technology initiatives already underway in school districts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]"

Following a comprehensive review, all the selected papers can be divided into nine generic groups in terms of problem focus in the service supply chain. These were production processes, human resources, logistics, information technology, theory and model generation, productivity and profitability, environmentally friendly practices, customer satisfaction and other cross-disciplinary studies. Four key aspects of the service supply chain are recommended for future research, namely: environment-friendly practices, market relationships, information technology integration and adoption of industry-specific case studies. In future extensions, additional work can include and correlate knowledge from other disciplines, theoretical perspectives, intellectual trends, and traditional practices associated with service industries.

More and more firms are beginning to adopt supply chain management (SCM) to improve performances of their organizations. This study examines the importance of incorporating supply chain management in Malaysian manufacturing companies. The study measures senior production or SCM managers' perceptions regarding SCM practices and performances of their companies. The paper specifically investigates relationship be-tween SCM, supply chain flexibility and business performance and these associations are analyzed through statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation and structural equation modeling (SEM). The overall result suggests that supply chain management has significant correlations with supply chain flexibility and business performance. Specifically, supply chain flexibility and business perform-ance have high correlations with SCM comprising programs such as 'strategic supplier partnership', 'lean production', 'postponement concept' and 'technology and innovation'. In addition, the SEM result also demonstrates that two supply chain management proxies specifically 'new technology and innovation' and 'lean production' appear to be of primary importance and exhibit most significant impact on supply chain flexibility and business performance. Findings of the study provide striking demonstrations of the importance of SCM programs in enhancing performances of Malaysian manu-facturing companies. The result indicates that manufacturing companies should emphasize greater attention to the technology aspects of SCM as well as waste reduction program through lean produc-tion and a greater degree of management support for SCM enhancement initiatives."

These models support integration of decision-making components with other parts of supply chain information system. Process modeling is also used to describe interrelationships among multiple decision-making models. This representation is used as the basis for implementation of integrated models. The service-oriented architecture is proposed as an implementation platform.

This study defines the distribution of total methane and CO2 emissions from the natural gas supply chain, identifying the contribution from each stage and quantifying the effect of key parameters on emissions. The study uses recent high-resolution emissions measurements with estimates of parameter distributions to build a probabilistic emissions model for a variety of technological supply chain scenarios. The distribution of emissions resembles a log-log-logistic distribution for most supply chain scenarios, indicating an extremely heavy tailed skew: median estimates which represent typical facilities are modest at 18–24 g CO2 eq./MJ HHV, but mean estimates which account for the heavy tail are 22–107 g CO2 eq./MJ HHV. To place these values into context, emissions associated with natural gas combustion (e.g. for heat) are approximately 55 g CO2/MJ HHV. Thus, some supply chain scenarios are major contributors to total greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas. For methane-only emissions, median estimates are 0.8–2.2% of total methane production, with mean emissions of 1.6–5.5%. The heavy tail distribution is the signature of the disproportionately large emitting equipment known as super-emitters, which appear at all stages of the supply chain. The study analyses the impact of different technological options and identifies a set of best technological option (BTO) scenarios. This suggests that emissions-minimising technology can reduce supply chain emissions significantly, with this study estimating median emissions of 0.9% of production. However, even with the emissions-minimising technologies, evidence suggests that the influence of the super-emitters remains. Therefore, emissions-minimising technology is only part of the solution: reducing the impact of super emitters requires more effective detection and rectification, as well as pre-emptive maintenance processes."

Many articles have been published with regards Industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. This paper aims to propose the term “Supply Chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of Industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. As Industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of Supply Chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of Supply Chain 4.0 strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (SLR) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, Industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. The three phases of the SLR process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. A concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the SLR to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. Findings: The SLR showed that there is limited research linking Industry 4.0 to supply chain. Nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. These constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. Each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the SLR. The SLR also demonstrated that maturity propositions for Industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. Hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of Supply Chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. As these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Research limitations/implications: This research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. As Supply Chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. As the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. Originality/value: The SLR demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of Industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. This research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. The value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form Supply Chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area."

By considering both fixed cost and tag cost of RFID implementation, we study the agents' incentives to adopt RFID in both uncoordinated and coordinated cases. We focus on analyzing the impact of risk attitudes on the agents' incentives and on the supply chain coordination. The central semi-deviation is adopted to measure the retailer's risk attitude. In the uncoordinated case, we find that, in order to induce the retailer to adopt RFID, the manufacturer must assume more fixed cost if the retailer is more risk-averse. In the coordinated case, we first show that the standard revenue sharing contract does not always coordinate the channel. If the channel is coordinated, we observe that the agents' incentives will be perfectly aligned and independent of the risk attitudes, if the revenue sharing ratio equals the fixed cost sharing ratio. Then we propose a risk-sharing contract that offers the risk protection to the retailer, to achieve the channel coordination. An interesting finding is that the manufacturer's incentive will not decrease with the tag cost, if she takes much risk from the retailer. The corresponding impacts of RFID adoption on the two contracts are also analyzed in this paper. Finally, a case study in a tobacco industry is presented to show the real RFID cost in practice. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Organizations have responded to these challenges by implementing collaborative supply chain management (SCM) which allows their organizations to gain competitive advantages. E-collaboration implementation is one of the key technologies to facilitate the success of SCM, which allows the integration of business processes and the sharing of information among supply chain members. E-collaboration has been implemented with considerable success in the supply chain by organizations such as Infineon and Wal-Mart. However, these large organizations have more financial and technical resources compared to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Little research on the implementation of e-collaboration has focused on the perspective of SMEs. Furthermore, most studies on e-collaboration implementation have traditionally examined the adoption stage of e-collaboration tools instead of a multi-stage diffusion process of technology. The main objective of this study is to understand the factors that influence the diffusion of e-collaboration in SCM among the SMEs. This study proposes a research model to examine a stage-based e-collaboration diffusion process in SMEs.

Here, using life cycle assessment we showed that ultrasonic humidification has the potential to reduce environmental impacts, including climate change impacts, of selected fruits and vegetables in Europe by up to 23% compared to conventional supply chains. The greatest potential is obtained when humidifiers are applied to fruits and vegetables chains with total inherent losses higher than 24% and when humidifiers allow reducing post-harvest losses in each post-harvest stage by 20% or more.

Design/methodology/approach: Strategic alternatives are investigated by using option pricing tools to examine the impact of various characteristics of green technology development and supply chain relations on the timing of the decision. Findings: The theoretical and empirical results show that a polluting firm should not consider the option of relocating to offshore countries if uncertainty has been anticipated. It is suggested that, by facing green technology development uncertainty, a firm should be refrained from relocating production abroad if technology develops and offshore cost advantage disappears soon. On the other hand, a pre-emptive migration strategy is preferable when the green technology is anticipated to be delayed. Practical implications: A polluting firm in a supply chain faces challenges of uncertainty depending on whether it decides to produce domestically or to relocate internationally. The analysis conveys a concept that polluting firms can be more profitable by promoting clean production technology, instead of relocating to offshore or so called pollution havens.

As a result, they have improved their ability to coordinate and synchronize shared business processes by using more complete, accurate, and timely information. These electronic linkages are based on open-standard interorganizational information systems (OSIOS), which are fundamentally different from traditional electronic data interchanges. OSIOS capture not only the technical specifications for data interchange but also the sequential steps for the execution of shared business processes. Because OSIOS are still at an early diffusion stage, it remains unclear why firms would assimilate such an innovation and whether assimilation provides firms any benefits. In this research, we develop a framework grounded on the economics of standards, institutional theory, and strategic interorganizational information systems literatures to investigate the drivers and outcomes of OSIOS assimilation in a focused context. In order to test our hypotheses based on this framework, we used data from a high-technology supply chain and employed econometrics techniques. We found that both competition asymmetry across supply chain echelons and OSIOS assimilation within supply chain echelons predict individual firms' OSIOS assimilation. The results also suggest that firms' supply chain dominance is both a driver and an outcome of OSIOS assimilation, highlighting a mutually reinforcing process. In addition, our study reveals boundary conditions of the hypothesized relationships. The use of multiple theoretical perspectives, a unique dataset, and innovative statistical techniques to investigate OSIOS assimilation in high-technology supply chains contributes to the body of knowledge in both the supply chain management and management of information systems disciplines."

Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on original survey data of 320 Chinese manufacturing firms gathered in China. Findings – The paper shows that inter-organizational ICT has a positive direct relationship with supply chain performance and this relationship is mediated by supply chain integration.

Methods: The BRUINchain system requirements include scanning the drug package for a correctly formatted 2D barcode, flagging expired product, verifying the product with the manufacturer, and quarantining suspect and illegitimate products at the last mile: pharmacist to patient, the most complex area of the drug supply chain. The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States. Results: In addition to communicating with the manufacturer directly for verification, BRUINchain also initiated suspect product notifications. During the study, a 100% success rate was observed across scanning, expiration detection, and counterfeit detection; and paperwork reduction from approximately 1 hour to less than a minute.

BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States.   Conclusions: By automatically interrogating the manufacturer’s relational database with our blockchain-based system, our results indicate a projected DSCSA compliance cost of 17 cents per unit, and potentially much more depending on regulatory interpretation and speed of verification. We project that this cost could be reduced with manufacturers’ adoption of a highly performant, fully automated end-to-end system based on digital ledger technology (DLT). In an examination of the interoperability of such a system, we elaborate on its capacity to enable verification in real time without a human in the loop, the key feature driving lower compliance cost. With 4.2 billion prescriptions being dispensed each year in the United States, DLT would not only reduce the projected per-unit cost to 13 cents per unit (saving $183 million in annual labor costs), but also serve as a major bulwark against bad or fraudulent transactions, reduce the need for safety stock, and enhance the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers."

The technology adoption process proposed in this study is based on technology acceptance model (TAM) with introduction of supply chain relationship factors. Since earlier studies indicated that environmental status may play a moderate role in the adoption process, moderation effect between the willingness and adoption of technologies is investigated. Major findings of the study include: (1) Perceived easiness of use and perceived usefulness directly affect technology acceptance willingness, but indirectly affect technology adoption through the willingness; (2) Supply chain relationship does not exert impacts on the willingness, but directly affects the adoption behavior. Based on the research findings, suggestions are provided for logistics and technology development industries when performing technological innovation."

This embraced the accountability for reverse logistics of the end-of-life products, which is seen as a costly and complex effort to be managed. This article develops a taxonomy for critical success factors (CSFs) of the reverse logistics capable of creating value for the company and its supply chain, from the perspective of the CE technical cycle, and provides a framework that represents the relationship between the CSFs and reverse logistics in the context of the circular supply chain. The methodology adopted was the tertiary literature review using content analysis with a sample of 66 reviews. The proposed taxonomy embraced five CSFs: Material Planning and Management, Life Cycle Assessment, Industrial Sustainability, Information and Communication Technology, and Promoters and Relationships. The framework illustrates how each component of the circular supply chain (i.e. Circular Inputs, Product Design, Process Design and Circular Flows) is influenced by the five CSFs of the reverse logistics obtained, highlighting the Promoters and Relationships CSF, since it influences all components of the circular supply chain and, consequently, reverse logistics."

Cross-sectional case study data is used to explore the impacts of SOX on SMEs adopting organizational theories as a lens for observing behavior and outcomes. The results of the study confirm that there are both benefits and costs associated with SOX compliance. All of the organizations studied experienced substantial improvements in enterprise risk management approaches. However, the level of difficulty experienced by the various organizations in implementing SOX requirements was highly variable and could be traced back to the underlying factors in structural inertia theory: size, complexity, experience with change, experience with strict controls, and adaptability. Perhaps the most important finding is that SOX does impact organizational flexibility to various degrees as predicted by theory; and this impact can in turn affect production cycle times, information technology investment, supply chain performance, and ultimately, market competitiveness."

Design/methodology/ approach - Using survey data, this study explores how IT adoption by a firm, in the context of supply chain communication systems, influences its market performance. Of special interest are improvements in both the firm's own and its partner's coordination activities. Criticality of a firm's channel partner is used as a moderating variable. Findings - Results suggest that a firm's own coordination mediates the influence of IT adoption on market performance only when the partner being coordinated is critical to its success. If the partner is not critical to the success of the firm, the benefits of IT adoption can be materialized only through enhancements in the coordination activities of the partner.

Poor demand and inventory visibility result in demand and supply mismatch of healthcare products in ways that may have dire economic and patient care consequences. For instance, a hospital drug shortage often requires an emergency delivery. These emergency refills increase cost and may disrupt a patient's recovery process. In recent years, innovations in information technology have been leveraged to improve supply chain collaboration and move closer to matching supply with demand. In this article, we build on that body of research by examining cloud computing as an enabler of electronic supply chain management systems (e-SCMs) that enhances collaborative information sharing in a multi-echelon hospital supply chain. We use systems theory and system dynamics to develop two conceptual, causal loop diagrams (CLDs); one representing traditional and the other cloud-based information sharing in a hospital supply chain. CLDs and their equivalent system dynamics models are used to simulate the performance of traditional and cloud-based hospital supply chains. We compare the performance metrics of both models: average inventory levels, lead time, and unfilled orders. The findings of this study show that cloud-based information sharing improves visibility in healthcare supply chains. As supply chain visibility increases, a hospital's responsiveness improves. Hospitals are now in a better position to accommodate fluctuations in patient demand and supply lead times. As a consequence, hospital supply chains will experience reductions in inventory costs, supply costs, and supply shortages."

We model the problem as a flowshop scheduling problem, uncover its structural properties, and prove that the problem is NP-hard in the ordinary sense only. We contribute by first developing a practical and effective pseudopolynomial dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal solution in reasonable time; second, proposing an implementable method to achieve win-win supply chain coordination; and third, showing the good performance of RFID technology deployment. We further determine the critical threshold value of the order number with which the total manufacturing capacity must be increased if companies in the supply chain wish to improve their profits."

To better promote supply chain emission reduction, this paper analyzes the carbon emission transfer and emission reduction problem among enterprises within the supply chain, integrating the influence of government emission reduction policies and the low carbon market. Considering the lag time of emission reduction technologies and the low-carbon preferences of consumers, a Stackelberg differential game model (dominated by manufacturers) is constructed under both centralized and decentralized decisions. The results suggest that the lag time of emission reduction technology and the low carbon preference of consumers positively affect the carbon emission transfer level of manufacturers, while not affecting suppliers’ undertaking levels. Only when the lag time of emission reduction technology remains within a specific range, will an increase in consumers’ low-carbon preferences exert a positive impact on supply chain profits. Notably, under decentralized decision-making, when the emission reduction technology lag time and consumers’ low carbon preference remain within a specific range, the carbon emission transfer behavior exerts a positive promoting effect on the emission reduction of the supply chain. This applies when the profit of the supply chain increases and the carbon emission reduction per unit of product decreases. This result provides a new idea for the government to control irrational carbon emission transfer behavior of enterprises. Moreover, considering the lag time of emission reduction technology is also conducive to increasing the acceptability of government carbon quota."

Historically, the uneven distribution of phosphate rock has been regarded as the major reason for this unbalanced use. However, the international trade of commodities may also play an important role in the unbalanced use of phosphorus fertilizers. By tracing the trade flows of commodities, we found that nearly 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer was embodied in traded commodities, which were mainly exported from large emerging countries (with low phosphorus use efficiencies) to developed countries (e.g., the US, Western Europe and Japan, commonly with high phosphorus use efficiencies). Furthermore, among the 5.2 Tg of phosphorus fertilizer embodied in traded commodities, 2.5 Tg was embodied in the trade of commodities from industry, construction, and services. Our results indicate that this trade pattern could create substantial mutual benefits if improvements are made to the phosphorus supply chain. With technology transfer and financial support from developed countries, large emerging countries could use phosphorus fertilizers more efficiently, thereby reducing the risk of eutrophication and lowering the cost of agricultural production. The phosphorus fertilizers saved by large emerging countries could be partially used to enhance food production in Sub-Saharan African countries. This optimized supply chain could reduce eutrophication, conserve phosphate rock resources, and enhance global agricultural production."

However, there are some problems in the multi-stage structure supply chain, such as untimely information feedback and distortion. Despite recent progress in ensuring improved collaboration in the past decade or so, the inefficiency status continues to persist. It is also difficult to add value to the supply chain. The information sharing framework and decentralized model designed in this paper are to deal with existing problems. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the theoretical research of supply chain information asymmetry and synergetics. We attempt to introduce blockchain technology into supply chain operation management, reconstruct information sharing architecture and provide a new decentralized mode to promote the collaborative operation of all nodes. The information sharing and decentralization operational model are built, which has changed the hierarchical relationship between upstream and downstream enterprises, regarding customers as the center of the whole system and effectively reducing the bullwhip effect. Finally, we selected the home supply chain as an example design and performed system dynamics simulation on the blockchain-based operation process. Findings: The model of setting up the scene application mode based on blockchain is helpful to realize the goal of supply chain management to reduce cost, improve quality and enhance the overall efficiency of the system.

Fulfilling this increased complexity of consumer demand has required supply chains to evolve into multienterprise networks with numerous flow paths in production, merchandising, and fulfillment involving many organizational/institutional handoffs, to effectively manage a large number of complex products with shorter life cycles and high transaction volumes. The supply chain management models of today place higher demands on automation and require a transition from the traditional paradigm of planning followed by long-loop execution for a handful of segments to a paradigm of managing a portfolio of end-To-end instrumented data-rich microsegmented supply chains that are monitored and adjusted in near real time. These essential aspects and challenges of supply chain management require the supporting information technology to also evolve. In this paper, we propose a novel reference software architecture to address the complex requirements of modern supply chains that also integrates blockchain into several layers of the stack. We present several examples where this reference architecture is applicable, and then demonstrate through a use case in production that integrating blockchain technology helps with providing visibility, documenting provenance, and allowing permissioned data access to facilitate the automation of many high-volume tasks such as reconciliations, payments, and settlements."

By analyzing the pricing, service, recycling decisions, and the profit of the supply chain members in different remanufacturing modes, it is shown that the FR remanufacturing mode not only promotes the retailer to improve the product service level, but also enables the third-party to improve the recovery rate. When the consumer's acceptance degree of remanufactured products reaches a certain level, relative to the MR and UR re-manufacturing modes, the FR remanufacturing model enables manufacturers, retailers, and third-party to simultaneously maximize profits.

Findings: SCM discipline is grappled with dynamic and operational changes and challenges and this unpredictability can be understood better using SD. ICT capabilities fundamentally improve supply chain integration and performance. ICT adoption for SCM improves collaboration, workflow and decision-making which lead to cost savings; improved operational efficiency and inventory visibility. One process in SCM namely inventory control is described using SD.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors follow a grounded theory approach for theory building based on interviews with senior managers of 15 organizations positioned across multiple echelons in the RSC. Findings: Findings reveal how user involvement shapes BDPA to fit organizational structures and how changes made to the technology retroactively affect its design and institutional properties. Findings also reveal previously unreported aspects of BDPA use for LSCM. These include the presence of temporal and spatial discontinuities in the technology use across RSC organizations. Practical implications: This study unveils that it is impossible to design a BDPA technology ready for immediate use. The emergent process framework shows that institutional and social factors require BDPA use specific to the organization, as the technology comes to reflect the properties of the organization and the wider social environment for which its designers originally intended. BDPA is, thus, not easily transferrable among collaborating RSC organizations and requires managerial attention to the institutional context within which its usage takes place. Originality/value: The literature describes why organizations will use BDPA but fails to provide adequate insight into how BDPA use occurs.

The key findings of this study can be summarised as follows: first, i4.0-enabled SCI extends the initial focus on productivity improvements in SC processes towards scalability and flexibility. Second, extant i4.0 solutions rely mostly on analytics and smart things while omitting smart people technology and the human-centric approach associated with the i4.0 paradigm. Third, established companies adopt i4.0 merely to sustain their existing business architectures while startup companies radically change their operating models, relying heavily on data analytics and the platform economy. Consequently, established companies pursue a problem-driven, engineering-based approach to SCI while startup companies follow an ‘asset-light’, business-driven approach.

Due to the propagation of information distortion along the supply chain, the financial impacts of inventory inaccuracy include not only the cost of direct inventory loss but also the increasing holding and shortage cost at each stage. The emergence of RFID technology offers a possible solution to alleviate the growing cost of inventory inaccuracy. By making full use of RFID technology, this paper attempts to compare the inventory inaccuracy impact on bullwhip effect in terms of order variance amplification and supply chain performance under two scenarios: (1) all members are aware of the inaccuracy and optimize their operations; (2) all members deploy RFID technology to reduce inventory inaccuracy. Informed order policy is used as benchmark to capture the true RFID value and differentiate two types of RFID impacts, prevention and visibility, to provide more manageable insight. In particular, the incentive of sharing information in supply chain is also provided by comparing the cost of two supply chain settings."

Based on the methods of mathematical and statistical analysis, it allows you to formalize and convert a large array of data of a qualitative order into a single scale for measuring the process under study - the level of demand in the regional socio-economic environment for block chain technology. The developed methodology is based on the theory of reputational economics, which allows, based on a system analysis of the global information space, to identify the level of demand for the research object in regional markets. Based on the collected and processed array of information and statistical data, the work carried out estimates of the index of reputation capital in the field of block chain technologies in the regions of the Volga Federal District for the period from 2010 to 2018. Based on the presented calculation data, a scientifically-based conclusion was obtained, according to which the regional ""block chain"" processes are beginning to take over the regional space of Russia more and more every year. Moreover, undoubtedly, as well as for any other phenomenon, this process is very differentiated in terms of penetration into the regional environment. In accordance with the estimates obtained, the regions with the highest level of demand for block chain technology and the outsider regions were identified. The implemented algorithm for the formalized assessment of the penetration of distributed data storage technologies into the regional environment creates the basis for a comparative analysis of the development efficiency of regions, determining their current and future competitiveness in the context of globalization and digitalization of reproduction processes."

Particularly, the game equilibrium in the cooperation between the smart supply chain platform and the cooperative under the subsidy and non-subsidy mechanisms of the government was analyzed. Finally, numerical simulation was implemented to analyze the effects of risks, intelligence degree, consumer preference and price on game equilibrium. The study results demonstrate: (1) In the range allowed by technology and cost, increasing the intelligence degree of the smart supply chain platform will benefit the cooperation between the smart supply chain platform and the cooperative; (2) Under high unsalable risks and unsalable losses, the cooperative will cooperate with the smart supply chain platform; (3) consumer preference influences not only the cooperative game between smart supply chain and cooperative, but also product demand and product price; and (4) under constant conditions, dependence on government subsidies is inversely proportional to the intelligence degree. In other words, enhancing the intelligence degree of the smart supply chain platform helps to transform the ”blood transfusion” poverty alleviation to “hematopoietic” poverty alleviation, and decreases the dependence of poverty alleviation on government financial platform subsidies."

In this paper, a coordination mechanism was examined by focusing on the freshness-keeping effort of third-party logistics service providers (TPLSPs) in a three-echelon cold supply chain. Optimal decisions concerning a carbon trading mechanism were examined based on a comparison of two decision systems: a decentralized system and a centralized system. An incentive scheme was proposed to motivate all three parties in a decentralized system to adopt the coordinated mechanism with self-regulation. The results of numerous experiments show that although an increased eco-friendliness effort would reduce market demand, total carbon emissions, and the supplier's profit, a reasonable revenue-and-cost-sharing contract can improve sales volume and balance the supply chain members' profit. With a coordination model, all members in the supply chain can benefit from Pareto improvement. Other proposals were also examined in the scheme.

It extends the unified theory of the acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by integrating personal innovativeness and trust in technology with the behavioural intention to adopt technology in the humanitarian context. Data from 192 humanitarian practitioners, who have experienced a large number of disasters, is utilized to empirically validate the conceptual model. The structural equation modelling results show that - out of four constructs namely performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions under UTAUT - performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly affect the IT adoption. Contrary to expectations, trust and personal innovation do not affect the behavioural intention. Also, personal innovation does not moderate the relationship between performance expectancy and effort expectancy. This underlines the need to foster a learning culture within these organizations. The efforts made by involved humanitarian organizations may be directed towards improving the level of education, skills and facilitating them with other resources such as appropriate IT and data mining training, so that the technology adoption becomes an integral part of their daily activities. Finally, detailed implications for humanitarian organizations are discussed."

Our heuristic approach requires moving beyond traditional finance-based thinking, and suggests that firms concentrate on technological trajectories by combining technology roadmapping, information technology (IT) and supply chain management to make more sustainable new product development decisions. Using the proposed holistic heuristic methods, versus relying on traditional finance-based decision-making tools (e.g., emphasizing net present value or internal rate of return projections), enables firms to plan beyond the short-term and immediate set of technologies at hand. Our proposed heuristic approach enables firms to forecast technologies and markets, and hence, new product priorities in the longer term. Investments in new products should, as a result, generate returns over a longer period than traditionally expected, giving firms more sustainable investments. New products are costly and need to have a durable presence in the market.

That is, most supply chains are no longer limited to a particular region. Because the numbers of branch nodes of supply chains have increased, products and raw materials vary and resource constraints differ. Thus, integrating planning mechanisms should include the capacity to respond to change. In the past, mathematical programming and a general heuristics algorithm were used to solve globalized supply chain network design problems. When mathematical programming is used to solve a problem and the number of decision variables is too high or constraint conditions are too complex, computation time is long, resulting in low efficiency, and can easily become trapped in partial optimum solution. When a general heuristics algorithm is used and the number of variables and constraints is too high, the degree of complexity increases. This usually results in an inability of people to think about resource constraints of enterprises and obtain an optimum solution. Therefore, this study uses genetic algorithms with optimum search features. This work combines the co-evolutionary mode, which is in accordance with various criteria and evolves dynamically, and constraint-satisfaction mode capacity to narrow the search space, which helps in finding rapidly a solution that, solves supply chain integration network design problems. Additionally, via mathematical programming, a simple genetic algorithm, co-evolutionary genetic algorithm, constraint-satisfaction genetic algorithm and co-evolutionary constraint genetic algorithm are used to compare the experiments result and processing time to confirm the performance of the proposed method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the consumer market demand and downstream investment conditions as input, we model a game in a two-tier supply chain where downstream firms choose to adopt different levels of an upstream technology and an upstream technology leader determines its pricing policy. We identify two necessary but distinct elements for the successful development, adoption, and diffusion of upstream technologies that are sold to lower tiers as components within final products. (1) The level of technology demanded by the market: We develop a measure, Technological Potential, which describes the highest level of an upstream technology demanded by consumer markets. (2) A sufficiently rich return to an upstream innovator, as a function of different levels of technology. From these two elements, we show that the relative magnitudes of two competing sets of consumer market factors determine the Technological Potential whereas the overall magnitude of the factors in both sets determines the return to the upstream developer. We discuss how this difference in consumer market factors’ influence on these two elements may determine how different technologies fare in the supply chain. Our results have managerial implications for: investors in research and development project selection in identifying profitable technologies that are also demanded at higher capability levels; and for governments in defining more targeted public policies – for example in choosing the right tier of a supply chain to provide subsidies – to encourage market support for certain technologies."

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

While its benefits are not in question, there is a paucity of research on potential pitfalls. This paper provides a conceptual foundation to address this gap and develops a comprehensive model of the risks of customer participation in service delivery, integrating research from the marketing, operations and supply chain management, strategy, and information technology fields. Design/methodology/approach: The model is derived deductively by integrating insights from research in marketing, operations and supply chain management, strategy, and information technology. Findings: This paper identifies three categories of potential risks of CP (i.e. market, operational, and service network) and discusses ways that firms can mitigate these risks. Building on the model, it develops a CP risk assessment tool that managers can use when evaluating increases in CP. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual model proposed in this paper can serve as a robust basis for future research in customer participation, particularly in such areas as sharing economy services, service delivery networks, and experiential services.

Although information and communication technologies have been used extensively in supply chains, there is a lack of systematic evidence regarding the mechanisms through which IT creates value. Furthermore, as supply chain objectives are going beyond operational efficiency towards pursuing higher-order goals, such as understanding the market dynamics and discovering new partnering arrangements to provide greater customer value, the capabilities that are needed for supply chains to sustain their competitive advantages need to be well understood by researchers and practitioners. To fill this gap, this research investigates the effects of the supply chain's collective knowledge management capability on the supply chain performance. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm and the relational view of firm's competitive advantage, this dissertation proposes a framework of supply chain IT capability as facilitating/inhibiting the supply chain's knowledge management capability. First, an empirical study using survey-based data collection was conducted. Second, a simulation model was built to investigate the mechanisms through which IT-enabled knowledge management activities affect firms' long-term knowledge outcome."

Tests empirically major propositions from this model using data from 83 firms positioned at the top of the Turkish automotive industry supply chain. Establishes that companies with higher levels of AMT implementation collaborate more with their parts suppliers and companies are more successful in achieving their AMT implementation objectives if increased AMT implementation is coupled with more collaborative supplier relationships. Both AMT implementation levels and buyer-supplier collaboration are shown to have significantly increased over a five-year period.

An exploratory qualitative multiple case study was carried out in a Footwear Supply Chain in Rio Grande do Sul (Gaúcha), Brazil. Eight accessory suppliers (first tier in the supply chain, such as: heels, buckles, and decorative ornaments), eight footwear manufacturing companies (footwear manufacturer or assembly companies), four retail companies, and four IT service providers. The research techniques used were semi-structured interviews, direct observation, and document analysis. The data analysis showed benefits and impediments to the integration of IT in the studied supply chain. It was found that two IT integration models have been adopted by the computer service providers: Proprietary (accessible only to the service providers) and Open (accessible to all companies) models. Although closed, the proprietary IT integration model is widely used given its simplicity and low cost. On the other hand, the Open Model enables higher organization in the internal processes of the IT management, inventory management, and production. The results obtained contribute to the literature since they show ways to improve Footwear Supply Chain development by increasing the speed and providing more productive flexibility to this sector. Although attractive, these developments can be hindered by commercial ventures of companies that adopt the Proprietary Model. The identification of these impediments suggests the need for further studies to increase the understanding of conflicts among supply chain partners."

Built upon a synthesis of the existing literature and relevant theories, this paper presents a research model that defines the drivers, strategy, and practices of a responsive supply chain and the performance outcomes. This paper is one of the rare empirical studies that identify key variables relevant to the implementation of a successful responsive supply chain. The effective implementation of a responsive supply chain requires a careful definition of a responsive supply chain strategy in terms of the product range, and the frequency and innovativeness of the product offerings. Firms also need to provide key implementation practices (i.e.; sharing of information with customers, collaboration with suppliers, use of advanced manufacturing technology) to achieve pull production to achieve responsiveness to the market. This study also suggests that the key contextual factors that influence the extent of implementation of a responsive supply chain strategy are mostly the size of firms, industry characteristics, and customer and supplier bases, rather than the location of manufacturing firms.

In most countries, blood management information systems, led by national institutions, operate centrally. However, existing centralized blood management systems have limitations in that they lack detailed blood information and, moreover, information is not reflected in real time. To solve this problem, this paper presents an innovative blood cold chain system based on blockchain technology. The proposed system aims to increase information visibility by recording the overall information on the blood supply and providing detailed blood information such as blood consumption and disposal to the distributed ledger. In addition, this paper proposes direct blood transactions between medical institutions in cases of emergency. Currently, blockchain technologies are being actively employed in the supply chain management and medical fields in addition to financial systems. Particularly, private blockchain techniques with limited participants are relatively fast and reliable, making them suitable for B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions. Therefore, the proposed system is based on the architecture of Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain technology implemented by the Hyperledger Composer tool. Information in the proposed blood cold chain system cannot be forged or tampered with, and information recorded and shared in real time is kept transparent. In addition, allowing for B2B blood transaction in special circumstances will minimize the blood supply time and enable patients to be transfused quickly. Moreover, the surplus blood of medical institutions will be used to increase the usage rate relative to the supply amount."

Establishing the right sourcing strategy for recycled material, therefore, is crucial for supply chains and for managing corporate sustainability tensions. We analyse the transaction costs in three strategic models of sourcing from ‘make’ inside the supply chain to contract, and ‘buy’ in the grey market for metals. ‘Blood metals’ leak into the grey markets when there is lack of control, information asymmetry in global supply chains and eco-opportunism in recycling of electronic products. Consequently, the need for traceable supply encourages companies to integrate closed-loop recycling of their products. Furthermore, scarcity of valuable metals along with consumer preferences for sustainable products lead to specific investments in product design and robot technology that disassemble end-of-life products. Together, these factors provide an integrated system that reduces transaction costs and increases recycling efficiency. Therefore, specific assets designed to facilitate reuse of scarce metals like the Apple robot Daisy is a key corporate strategy to secure sustainable performance. Specific investments in disassembling technology like robots in the smartphone industry, should, according to transaction cost theory, be organised as a vertically integrated circular economy. The integrated closed-loop model presented here, control eco-opportunism and the unsustainable character of grey markets for recycled material in electronics."

The unfortunate consequence of this approach is the bullwhip effect. An alternative approach is some form of collaborative scenario. Unfortunately, neither approach guarantees optimisation across the supply chain. The fundamental reason for this is found in the rational behaviour that participants in the process adhere to. As it is impossible to suppress rational behaviour, a solution for this problem is sought through orchestration and rigorous implementation of the Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) process. A technology framework that promises to facilitate this objective is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based on web services.

A questionnaire survey was performed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data related to logistics processes of each player. Starting from these data, a feasibility study has been carried out in order to assess the economical suitability of RFID and EPC adoption in the FMCG supply chain, both for each player and for the FMCG supply chain as a whole. Results of the feasibility study show that RFID and EPC implementation is still not profitable for all echelons examined.

In this paper, we look at the impact of the two, in the context of supply-chain networks. With the advent of information technology, supply chains have acquired a complexity almost equivalent to that of biological systems. However, one of the major challenges that we are facing in supply-chain management is the deployment of coordination strategies that lead to adaptive, flexible and coherent collective behaviour in supply chains. The main hurdle has been the lack of the principles that govern how supply chains with complex organizational structure and function arise and develop, and what organizations and functionality are attainable, given specific kinds of lower-level constituent entities. The study of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), has been a research effort attempting to find common characteristics and/or formal distinctions among complex systems arising in diverse domains (like biology, social systems, ecology and technology) that might lead to a better understanding of how complexity occurs, whether it follows any general scientific laws of nature, and how it might be related to simplicity. In this paper, we argue that supply chains should be treated as a CAS. With this recognition, we propose how various concepts, tools and techniques used in the study of CAS can be exploited to characterize and model supply-chain networks. These tools and techniques are based on the fields of nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics and information theory."

Exploring these questions can contribute knowledge to the field of operations management: how firms can employ their IT capabilities for operations and supply chain management, the impact of competitive and institutional environments on IT-based operations strategy; the relationships between IT-enabled supply chain practices and operations performance. This paper addresses these aspects by examining the factors affecting Chinese firms' adoption of IT-enabled supply chain operations and the benefits they achieve, by drawing from and integrating the resource-based and institutional theoretic perspectives. It identifies key organizational and institutional factors that influence firms' technology adoption for supply chain management. Results show that firms can benefit by incorporating the technology within their internal operations processes and by using the technology externally with partners in their supply chain trading community. The results provide evidence that firms' IT engagement for operations and supply chain management is significantly influenced by institutional factors. Association analysis was conducted to understand the potential influence of external diffusion on internal assimilation. The result supports the theoretical claim. Building on the existing literature, this study demonstrates how resource-based theory and institutional theory can provide a solid theoretical backbone for practitioners, researchers, and policy makers in efforts pertaining to technology adoption for operational supply chain excellence. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As people gradually realize the importance of the environment, low carbon has become one of the core indicators of power system evaluation, so it is particularly important to guide the coal enterprises to achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits. Combined with the carbon emission policies, this paper takes the coal supply chain network as the research object and aims to develop a comprehensive decision model for sustainable design of coal supply chain. First, this paper extracts the influencing factors of low-carbonization in coal supply chain and constructs an interpretative structural model (ISM). The results show that low-carbon green technology, low-carbon production cost, utilization level of green energy and energy efficiency are the most basic manifestations of low-carbonization of coal supply chain and interact with each other, therefore this paper builds an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the low-carbon production costs in the coal supply chain. Concurrently, this paper introduces four policies (emission cap, carbon tax, carbon trade and carbon offset) as constraint condition. Then, in the aspect of model solving, this paper combines the differential evolution (DE) strategy to mutate, cross and select the leaders generated in each iteration of the salp swarm algorithm (SSA), further increases the diversity of the salp swarm, avoids the algorithm falling into a local optimum, and proposes the salp swarm algorithm based on differential evolution (DE-SSA). Finally, this paper compares the effects of four different carbon emission policies on the optimization of coal supply chain network through empirical analysis, and finds that coal enterprises have the best emission reduction effect under the carbon trade policy. The development and implementation of this paper not only enriches the related research of efficient supply chain, but also provides scientific and quantifiable decision-making technology for coal enterprises."

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of clean technology adoption and environmental taxes on the TA supply chains. First, we consider a monopoly case, where a two-echelon supply chain consists of one buyer and one manufacturer. We find that raising the environmental tax rate motivates the manufacturer to invest in green technologies. We then extend our model to examine the duopoly case. We find that in the duopoly case, if the buyer's market share is sufficiently small (large), the optimal greenness level for this buyer's product decreases (increases) in the environmental tax rate; whereas if the two products market shares are relatively equal, the optimal greenness levels for both products buyers increase in the environmental tax rate. The existence of the spillover effect reduces the cost and improves the product greenness. Consumer welfare can be improved if the efficiency of green technology adoption and the coefficient of greenness level on market demand are sufficiently high. This result implies that if the government cares about consumers, the manufacturer should be encouraged to enhance the cost reduction ability in terms of green technology, and consumer education about sustainability consciousness should be enhanced."

They must understand the inter-relationships of all assembled products in any new planned system in terms of its resilience under attack. These system owners will also increasingly assess the risks they may inherit from a global interconnected supply chain. To address these concerns, the recommendation in this paper is for providers of Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology products to perform a criticality analysis on their own products to gauge resilience, rather than later be confronted by an acquirer attempting to solely reverse engineer the system as part of supply chain due-diligence. This paper illustrates the roles that technology providers and system owners each play in following the outlined approach that highlights key risk factors of the tiered suppliers for product elements deemed most critical. ICT COTS providers who do not want to divulge sensitive information about their suppliers can use a ""representational assurance"" approach to convey meaningful information to potential acquirers without undue disclosure. Analytical graphics such as ""Treemaps"" can help all parties illustrate where to best focus their attention regarding critical operational risk and supply chain risk. The same data that providers track internally to manage product assurance can be leveraged to support meaningful representational assurance to acquirers.

We use price commitment as basis to study several scenarios, such as centralized/decentralized decision system, pure price commitment contract, commitment to wholesale price and cost-sharing contract, and two-part tariff contract. Accordingly, we mainly discuss if these contracts can improve the sustainability investment level of suppliers and if Pareto improvement can be achieved. Results show that the pure price commitment contract can neither improve suppliers sustainability investment level nor coordinate the supply chain. By contrast, with a combination on price and sharing ratio, commitment to wholesale price with cost sharing is beneficial in enhancing suppliers sustainability investment level and can achieve the Pareto improvement in profit for supply chain members.

It should be noted that the six-dimensional (6D) sustainability model used in this study will be a useful and comprehensive model for industries. Since, the new dimension of IT along with the five well-known economic, social, environmental, technical and institutional aspects of organizations is considered to have great impacts on supply chain sustainability; the proposed framework can be practical. Design/methodology/approach According to the related literature review, there are two research streams in supply chain management. The first stream is exploratory research, seeking out conceptual discussions in this area. The second one is associated with mathematical models and techniques, aiming to set decision-making rules in this regard (Agrell et al., 2004). In this study, evaluation was performed using the FMEA method as an analytical technique based on the principle of pre-occurrence prevention to identify potential failure factors in sensitive systems (Mohammadfam and Kianfari, 2008). Findings After identifying the risks and causes of the incidence and effects and consequences of risks, preventive and risk control measures and advisory strategies were presented. Customers with 45.76% share in critical risks are threatening to maintain supply chain in these companies. During this study, it was found that 33.9% of the main source of supply chain critical risks was customers, constituting 45.76% of such risks, accompanied by organization, having a 38.88% share of critical risk generation. The study findings also revealed that 33.9% of critical risks were mainly (equally) related to economic and technical aspects of supply chain sustainability in telecommunication networks. Moreover, as a newly-introduced sixth dimension, IT represented 10.17% of critical risks threatening supply chain sustainability in such networks. Critical risks are mainly related to the economic and technical aspects (equally) with the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain. Also, as a new finding and the sixth dimension, 10.17% of the critical risks that threaten the sustainability of the telecommunication networks supply chain have the information technology dimension. Originality/value The internet and fixed and mobile data services are provided by several private companies in Iran, which are relatively similar in terms of their supply chains. In order to manage the sustainability of Iran's telecommunication supply chain, telecommunication networks affiliated to Iran Telecommunication Company (ITC), operating in the field of data and internet services and fixed telephone were selected in 31 provinces. The intended networks were also providing an important part of the country's needs including Mobile Telecommunication Company of Iran, a subsidiary of Iran's telecommunication networks, as one of the top companies in this industry. Accordingly, all the networks studied in this study needed to be identified with regard to communication sustainability risks, since they provide management solutions to each other by segregating risks. In this study, 68 managers and 72 experts participated in different work teams of telecommunication networks."

Findings: The new supplier transparency measure is a concise, two-dimensional scale that has the potential for significant usage in the development and testing of SCM theory. Research limitations/implications: This study implemented a purposefully general sampling procedure. However, different industries may have additional, specific constraints regarding what it means to be a transparent supplier. Additional opportunities for future research include applying the new supplier transparency measure to examine supply chain frameworks, regulatory compliance, supply chain relationships and the implementation of information technology. Practical implications: Firms are under increasing pressure to be transparent about partner sourcing, resource utilization and other transactional issues related to the products and processes in their supply chains. The new measure may be utilized to address these issues as well as the interaction between supply chain operations and stakeholders by facilitating a quantitative assessment of supplier transparency. Originality/value: Drawing on the established constructs of supply chain visibility and traceability, a measure of supplier transparency is developed, supported by a review of the literature, input from subject matter experts and interviews with supply chain managers. Suggestions are made for future validation of supplier transparency within established supply chain frameworks."

Insights on cost reductions are obtained from a detailed stakeholder survey conducted amongst the European wind power industry in 2012. Overall, a rather more optimistic view of the scope for cost reductions in offshore technology is presented than has previously been evident in empirical analysis. From the analysis we conclude that the wind power industry has experienced a decoupling process of the offshore supply chain from its onshore counterpart with diverging technological requirements. For policy-makers, it is essential to acknowledge that barriers to adoption and the consequent needs for subsidies among the players in the onshore and offshore supply chains seem to differ, and that a micro-level analysis of the innovations and risks involved at the various stages in the supply chain is necessary."

This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits."

Lead companies, often retailers, introduce this technology for specific objectives, such as assuring traceability or improving sales and reputation. At the same time, the technology could impact much more broadly the performances of food chains. Little is known about this impact as the evidence provided in the literature is scarce and mostly focused on specific indicators. This paper addresses this gap assessing the impact of the blockchain technology on food supply chains from an explorative perspective. An integrated conceptual framework is proposed which includes a broad set of performance dimensions discussed in the literature: efficiency, flexibility, responsiveness, food quality, and transparency of supply chains. These dimensions are assessed using a case study, consisting of three supply chains where a large European retailer has promoted the blockchain adoption. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with key managers at different stages of the three supply chains and were systematically analysed through a thematic analysis. Results reveal that blockchain technology impacts positively on the profit and/or return on investment of supply chains, it leads to an increase of extrinsic food quality attributes and it fosters a better information management along the food chains due to an improved information accessibility, availability and sharing. The current analysis also suggests an improved management of behavioural uncertainty among the agents of the supply chains and an increase of firm's knowledge as well as supply chain management competencies. While the study remains of explorative nature, it offers a basis for the selection of theoretical approaches and the formulation of new hypotheses for future blockchain studies."

In particular, this allowed the modelling of carbon emissions trends within, and between the BRICS nations and with the Rest-of-the-World over a 20-year period (1992–2011) as well as providing an opportunity to hypothesis on their future carbon emissions performances. Specific analyses of the Metal Product industry showed that demand represents the main driver for the increasing carbon footprint. However, the overall decline in reported carbon footprint was due to improvements in emissions intensity and efficiency gains induced by technology. The study further assesses the effects of imports and economic growth on carbon footprint and discusses the implications of the study to sustainability transition processes in the BRICS nations."

This paper studies the effects of VMI on a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to shed light on when an IT investment for VMI adoption can be justified. We show that whether the two supply chain members benefit from VMI depends on how the holding or shortage cost increment from the manufacturer to retailer compares with two corresponding critical values. We then develop comparative statics results on how these critical values change with respect to different parameters. Interestingly, the retailer is more likely to benefit from the adoption of VMI when its inventory holding cost is low, and the manufacturer is more likely to benefit from VMI adoption when its inventory holding cost is high, contradicting what our intuitions would suggest and what has been prescribed in the literature."

In this paper, first, the concept and function of supply chain finance were elaborated, and the theoretical basis of supply chain financial risk control was studied. The implement of principal agent, information asymmetry theory, and self-compensated trade finance theory on realizing the risk avoidance in the actual development process was analyzed. Then, the business processes of the three basic financing models of supply chain finance and the shortcomings in the operation of each model were proposed. On this basis, risk sources and influencing factors of supply chain finance were analyzed, and operational risks were emphasized. Finally, a new financing mode of inventory pledge was designed based on the special function of Internet of Things (IoT) technology and the business process of inventory financing mode. The results showed that there was a big gap in the value of risk loss caused by various types of loss events in the operation risk of supply chain finance inventory pledge financing mode; among them, the biggest losses were from external fraud. By comparing the expected loss (ES) value of inventory pledge financing mode based on the IoT with the operation risk of traditional mode, it could be found that the supply chain finance mode based on the IoT technology effectively reduced the operation risk. Therefore, the system designed in this paper has certain reference and practical significance for financial risk management."

This waste emerges for a number of reasons. Medicines are often ordered in too large quantities, which leads to stock expiring without being dispensed. Wastage can also be a consequence of poor management practices. Technical aids, such as automatic dispensers, have been suggested to reduce waste, but they too have shortcomings. Information systems can arguably contribute to waste reduction, but this area has not been widely researched. In this exploratory case study, we scrutinized the management of medicines waste in a hospital from an information systems perspective and examined how information systems are used to manage the medicine supply chain and medicine waste. Our research case was a Finnish university hospital, its central pharmacy, and, more widely, the medicine supply chain within the hospital. Methods: This is a qualitative case study, based on data gathered through interviews and a survey and a review of other information sources, including annual reports and other relevant collateral. The study participants included pharmacy staff members and other hospital staff involved in medicine supply. The interviews were conducted in two rounds, first capturing the main themes and then exploring them further in the later study stages. Results: The findings outline a picture of unfit technology and inconsistent and unreliable information. This is compensated for by manual practices and processes that cause an excessive administrative burden and ultimately increased wastage. An infrequent ordering process combined with the lack of recycling practices increase the wastage even more. Conclusion: Medicine supply and waste management remain a manual administrative task. Inconsistent information and unfit information systems make this task challenging, and the process relies on the medicine supply staff's experience and assumptions."

Unlike the well-developed supply chain finance (SCF) using guarantees provided by a core enterprise, the effectiveness of SCF with self-guarantee is unclear, especially in a multi-sided market setting. The current paper explores this effectiveness by building an analytical model involving four kinds of players: a multi-sided platform, a customer, a bank, and multiple transportation service providers. In this setting, a traditional SCF model with Platform Undertakes Guarantee (PUG) and a novel SCF strategy with self-guarantee (i.e. Customer Undertakes Guarantee (CUG)) are analysed. The results indicate that CUG can bring a Pareto improvement for the market compared to PUG. Although CUG displays higher efficiency, it is not always beneficial to the platform when the customer's opportunity cost rate is higher than the platform's. Furthermore, to mitigate credit risk caused by a low-credit customer, the platform may employ a prepayment strategy. Analytical results of this study indicate that the prepayment ratio does not affect the customer's cost, and thus, providing a high prepayment ratio but a relatively low service fee rate to low-credit customers is suggested to the platform."

Where many previous studies have identified technology as the key determinant, we argue that operational and behavioural perspectives should be duly taken into consideration while adopting e-technology. Therefore, inspired by the systems engineering principles, we propose a generic framework for evaluating business performance of e-supply chain companies. A questionnaire was designed and survey data from 208 Malaysian SMEs was collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to test the impact of Supply Chain Strategy, E-Business Adoption, and the interaction of these constructs, on overall Business Performance. With regards to the operational perspective the results suggest that E-Business Adoption relates more positively to Business Performance compared to Supply Chain Strategy construct. Also, Technology Capability scored relatively higher compared to Organisational Capability and Attitudinal Capability. Overall Supply Chain Relationship (behavioural perspective) demonstrates a relatively weak result. Our findings suggest that where Malaysian SMEs are technology orientated, however, they need to develop efficient logistics networks to cater for a geographically dispersed population. Also, they need to pay serious attention towards 'softer' issues, in that to bring about attitudinal changes that allow developing closer collaboration with their supply chain companies. We argue that operational and behavioural perspectives can be embedded within the systems engineering principles that provide necessary theoretical underpinning for conducting such a research. The empirical findings provide useful guidelines for SMEs that wish to embark upon an e-business adoption journey. Furthermore, the measures produced here can be used as a benchmarking exercise for the SMEs who have already adopted e-technology."

Setting: Study was conceptualised during re-location of a 355-bed general hospital to newer premises within Singapore with an increased capacity of 700 beds. Study duration was 1.5 years and data collection was performed from Sep 2014 to Sep 2015.Results: Automating the inventory check and use of automated guided vehicles for medical supplies can improve business and operational performance by saving time on no-value added activities that can be transferred to patient care. RFID intervention requires least number of man-hours per day reducing the total manpower requirements by about one third as compared to the manual process while improving productivity by about 40%, it also provides cost savings of about 25% over a period of 10 years. Sensitivity analysis shows that extent of these cost savings are dependent on overall staff utilisation. Although use of AGV alone is expensive in our model, combining AGVs with RFID technology provides the least manpower dependence among the different interventions studied, it also gives a positive return on investment as compared to manual process beyond 3 years of operations.Conclusions: Optimising supply chains within healthcare helps minimise manpower dependency and costs. However, prior to adopting a specific intervention, the unique characteristics of each healthcare setting should be considered. There is need for similar research into healthcare supply chains to identify key determinants to cost savings and improving productivity, both locally and regionally."

Practitioners and researchers alike who take a relational perspective widely regard supplier involvement as a potentially effective strategy to cope with technology uncertainty, as focal manufacturers can tap into their upstream supply networks for complementary resources and capabilities. However, the literature lacks a nuanced understanding of the supplier involvement processes. Specifically, the role of resource dependence for supplier involvement has yet to be systematically understood. To fill this gap, this study aims to combine the relational perspective with the resource-dependence perspective to explore how buyer dependence, supplier dependence and buyer–supplier interdependence influence buyers’ decision-making on tapping into upstream supply networks for coping with technology uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, a survey is conducted among Dutch firms with more than 50 employees in the discrete manufacturing industries (ISIC 28-35), resulting in a sample of 125 manufacturers. Findings: First, there is a significantly positive relationship between technology uncertainty and supplier involvement, giving support to the expectation that buyers are indeed involving their key suppliers in the product/process design and improvement, as a response to technology uncertainty. Second, buyer dependence and interdependence are found to be positively moderating the relationship between technology uncertainty and supplier involvement. In contrast, supplier dependence has a negative moderating effect on the baseline relationship. Research limitations/implications: The authors contribute to a relational view on buyer–supplier relationships by showing that the validity of this view, in the context of technology uncertainty, is contingent on the resource dependence between buyers and suppliers, and the authors contribute to the supply chain management literature more generally by combining a relational perspective with a resource-dependence perspective. Practical implications: The findings provide several nuanced insights into the effect of resource dependence (buyer dependence, supplier dependence and interdependence) on supplier involvement for coping with technology uncertainty. Originality/value: This study contributes to the supply chain management research by going beyond the benefits of supplier involvement and highlights the circumstances under which supplier involvement is likely to occur."

The market value of pharmaceutical counterfeiting has reached billions of dollars annually. One of the reasons for drugs counterfeiting is the imperfect supply chain system in pharmaceutical industry. Drugs change ownership from manufacturers to wholesaler, distributer and then pharmacist before it reach the customer. In current supply chain system, information is not shared between systems, manufacturers don't know what happened to their products, drugs regulatory authority has no visibility of the system, recalls are complicated and costly, and companies cannot follow-up patients. In this paper we explain how to use blockchain technology in pharmaceutical supply chain to add traceability, visibility and security to the drugs supply system. The proposed system will be used in pharmaceutical industry to track the drugs from its manufacturing until its delivery to patient. After the usage of a drug, its effect on patient will be recorded to a database for future statistics. A permissioned blockchain will be used for storing transactions and only trusted parties will be allowed to join the network and push data to blockchain."

This study developed a conceptual model based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. A Web-based structured questionnaire was developed to collect primary data. With three months effort, this study managed to get 205 respondents from Malaysian manufacturing and service industry. Multiple regression and Dominance analysis were applied to understand the effect of the TOE framework on Web 2.0 adoption and predicting the importance of each factor form different industries perspective respectively. Multiple regression results confirmed that all the factors are important for Web 2.0 adoption, however, the technological characteristic is the most important determinant for Web 2.0 adoption. Moreover, dominance analysis showed very interesting results that relative advantage is not important for the service industry but top management support is the utmost importance. Similarly, results also indicated that top management support plays important role in Web 2.0 adoption for the fewer experience companies pertaining to internet usage. This study is one of the very few that provides insightful information regarding the effect of the TOE on Web 2.0 adoption in the supply chain management system.

Increasing business dynamics, changing customer preferences, and disruptive technological shifts pose the need for two kinds of flexibility that interenterprise information systems must address - the ability of interenterprise linkages to support changes in offering characteristics (offering flexibility) and the ability to alter linkages to partner with different supply chain players (partnering flexibility). This study explores how enterprises in supply chains may forge supply chain linkages that enable both types of flexibility jointly, and allow them to deal with ubiquitous change. Drawing on March and Simon's coordination theory, we propose two design principles: (1) advance structuring of interorganizational processes and information exchange that allows partnering organizations to be loosely coupled, and (2) IT-supported dynamic adjustment that allows enterprises to quickly sense change and adapt their supply chain linkages. This study reports on a survey of 41 supply chain relationships in the IT industry. For design principle, our empirical investigation of factors shows (1) that modular design of interconnected processes and structured data connectivity are associated with higher supply chain flexibility, and (2) that deep coordination-related knowledge is critical for supply chain flexibility. Also, sharing a broad range of information with partners is detrimental to supply chain flexibility, and organizations should instead focus on improving the quality of information shared. Fo r industry managers, the study provides clear insights for information infrastructure design. To manage their interdependencies, enterprises need to encapsulate their interconnected processes in modular chunks, and support these with IT platforms for information exchange in structured formats. Enterprises also need to nurture their execution capabilities by putting in place the information systems to process information exchanged with partners, augmenting their understanding of factors such as how partner actions need to trigger adaptive responses. For researchers, the study initiates a new stream of theorizing that focuses on the role of the information infrastructure in managing the tension between competing goals of offering flexibility and partnering flexibility. © 2005 M.E.

We demonstrated that the proposed TPT contract can achieve global supply chain optimization and aid in achieving green improvement. We further illustrated that the optimal green improvement degree is influenced by green technology investment, government intervention, and additional demand from customer green preferences. We showed that stronger government intervention may not always lead to higher green improvement and government should switch from taxes to subsidies in the high green investment cost scenario.

The authors test whether BDA mediates the impact of institutional response to supply chain disruption events, and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), on firm’s ability to develop risk resilience from supply chain disruption events.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on survey data collected from 225 firms, spread across several sectors in the USA and Europe. The respondents are primarily senior and middle management professionals who have experience within the information technology (IT) and supply chain domain. Validity and reliability analyses were performed using SPSS and AMOS; and covariance-based structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesis.FindingsThe analysis reveals two significant findings. First, the authors observe that institutional experience with managing supply chain disruption events has a negative impact on firm’s ability to develop business risk resilience. However, if the organizations adopt BDA capabilities, it enables them to effectively utilize resident firm knowledge and develop supply chain risk resilience capacity. The results further suggest that BDA positively adds to an organization’s existing IT capabilities. The analysis shows that BDA mediates the impact of ITIC on the organization’s ability to develop risk resilience to supply chain disruption events.Originality/valueThis study is one of the few works that empirically validate the important role that BDA capabilities play in enabling firms develop business risk resilience from supply chain disruption events. The study further provides a counterpoint to the existing perspective within the supply chain risk management literature that institutional experience of managing past supply chain disruption events prepares the organization to deal with future disruption events.

The rice supply chain in Indonesia varies from one region to another and it is difficult to trace movement along the chain from land to customers. This introduces non-transparency and uncertainty in the quantity and quality of rice at every node along the supply chain. The crucial issues of food safety and security, as well as consumer concern and curiosity in buying and consuming foods, increases the need for a traceability system for the rice value chain which can be easily and widely accessed. This paper describes the design framework of an IT (Information Technology)-based traceability system for the rice supply chain on web platforms. The system approach has been followed (where the system requirements are identified based on supply chain characteristics) and then the logical framework for implementing internal and external traceability was modeled using IDEF-0 (Integrated Definition Modeling). This paper further presents an explanation of the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) as an initial step to modeling the data requirements and a model of information exchange between stakeholders that explains the data that must be recorded and forwarded to the next stakeholder. Finally, we propose the CBIS (Computer Based Information System) concept to develop a traceability system in the rice supply chain."

In this regard, innovation in products, organizational structures, and business methods can be the key to achieving economic, social, and environmental outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how sustainable-oriented innovations (SOI) can influence inter-organizational relationships in sustainable supply chain management. The research is based on two case studies of Brazilian focal companies (Braskem and Mercur) and their respective suppliers and customers. We have identified different realities regarding operational aspects, supply chain structure, and the strategic orientation for sustainability. The cases outlined provide in-depth insights into the forms of SOI, i.e. product and organizational innovations. A practical implication includes the illustration of how the sustainability innovations allow the reaping of positive effects to businesses along the supply chain. Collaborative relationships with suppliers and buyers can be seen as a source of learning, development of new technology processes, and information acquisition. We position our research within the realm of sustainable SCM as a contribution to the increasingly discussed relationship dimensions and present links to the sustainable innovation literature, which is rarely amalgamated with the SCM discipline. This establishes a more concrete connection, where further research at this intersection would be required."

Information technology has greatly helped in information sharing and other allied activities in the supply chain, thereby promoting transparency and fairness in the supply chain operations. Since many executives of the IT industry are involved in designing supply chain operations and providing allied solutions coupled with the fact that supply chain operations are still at a nascent stage in India, it gave us an impetus to study the various antecedents of supply chain resilience in the Indian context from a survey of 141 IT executives. Till now, most of the studies on supply chain resilience are anecdotal or conceptual in nature. By empirically exploring the factors like supply chain reengineering, agility, collaboration and risk management as antecedents to supply chain resilience, this study makes an important contribution to the literature of supply chain resilience from a methodology perspective.

In the green product supply chain, a manufacturer produces green product through developing green technology and a retailer promotes the green product through green marketing. The demand of the green product is uncertain with the mean and the variance as the only known information. After analyzing the utility that a consumer gained from the green product, the problem is then formulated as a distribution-free-based Stackelberg game for a decentralized system under three contracts, i.e., wholesale price-only (WPO), revenue and green marketing cost-sharing (RGMS), and two-part tariff (TPTF) contracts. The analytical results are also proposed to show the effects of the system parameters on supply chain optimal decisions. By comparing with the centralized system, the coordination level for each contract is investigated. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis with respect to several system parameters are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the contracts under demand uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both RGMS and TPTF contracts are superior to WPO contract. Especially, TPTF contract can always coordinate the supply chain, while RGMS contract can improve the supply chain coordination level only if the revenue and cost sharing coefficients satisfy certain conditions."

The results of the interviews enabled the author to identify which variables to investigate further through the use of a survey data collection protocol. In the present study, 273 first-tier supply chain members of the second-largest U.S. automotive service-parts logistics operation, who were recently introduced to a new supply chain management technology, were surveyed. Using a structural equation model, nine hypotheses were tested. As hypothesized, an individual's technology trust and interorganizational trust have an effect on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, which further influence postadoption technology utilization behavior. The results suggest that even in supply chains where usage is mandated, the presence of technology and interorganizational trust can increase individual utilization of new technologies.

In order to provide resiliency against existing epistemic uncertainties and disruption risks in the supply chain, a hybrid robust stochastic-possibilistic programming approach is employed. The proposed model minimizes total expected cost of the supply chain over non-disruption and disruption scenarios while limiting greenhouse gas emissions for sustainability considerations. The model determines the optimal supply chain strategic and tactical decision variables such as location, capacity and technology of biorefineries, transportation modes, shipments, inventory levels and production and import amounts. The performance of the model is evaluated through a real case study developed in Iran. Comparing the proposed resilient model with its non-resilient counterpart reveals that the proposed model is superior both in cost and GHG emissions reductions.

A successful supply chain optimization project that leveraged technology, engineering principles, and a technician workflow redesign in the setting of a growing health system is described. Summary. With continued rises in medication costs, medication inventory management is increasingly important. Proper management of central pharmacy inventory and floor-stock inventory in automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) can be challenging. In an effort to improve control of inventory costs in the central pharmacy of a large academic medical center, the pharmacy department implemented a supply chain optimization project in collaboration with the medical center's inhouse team of experts on process improvement and industrial engineering. The project had 2 main components: (1) upgrading and reconfiguring carousel technology within an expanded central pharmacy footprint to generate accurate floor-stock inventory replenishment reports, which resulted in efficiencies within the medication-use system, and (2) implementing a technician workflow redesign and algorithm to right-size the ADC inventory, which decreased inventory stockouts (i.e., incidents of depletion of medication stock) and improved ADC user satisfaction. Conclusion. Through a multifaceted approach to inventory management, the number of stockouts per month was decreased and ADC inventory was optimized, resulting in a one-time inventory cost savings of $220,500."

At present, the terms ""Digital Supply Chain"", ""Supply Chain 4.0"", ""Digital logistics"", and ""Smart logistics"" are widely used in business, and in particular, in the theory and practice of supply chain management (SCM). This demonstrates the relevance of the implementation of Industry 4.0 innovations into the practical activities of manufacturing, trading, and logistics companies, interconnected by networking in the process of delivering products or services to final consumers. In turn, this causes fundamental changes in the structure of supply chains, their business processes and behaviours, making existing approaches to management obsolete. Purpose of the article: The article aims at identifying supply chain development drivers under the conditions of 'Industry 4.0'; determining the effect of DT in the cross-section of strategic and operational changes of supply chain; clarifying the readiness and capacity for DT implementation in the enterprises activity as exemplified by the enterprises operating in Ukraine in various fields of activity. Methods: Stratified proportional sampling was applied as the research method. Ukrainian enterprises of different size, involved in different supply chains, were considered as an object of research. The attitude of the Ukrainian enterprises to the DT implementation is presented, and the results are compared to the relevant research data in other countries. Findings & Value: This study will be valuable to both scientists and practitioners. Scientists will be able to understand the conceptual transformation of SC under the influence of DT. Practitioners will become aware of the following issues: current SCM trends and requirements; DT effects on the strategic and operational levels of the classical model of management; the level of readiness and ability of the Ukrainian enterprises to implement DT in their activities as compared to the enterprises in other countries."

We confirm that the supplier's development capability has a significant impact on contract feasibility. The revenue-sharing contract helps to attain a higher new product quality level and profit for the supply chain. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between a manufacturer and a supplier concerning the performance of the new product development project. Adopting a Nash bargaining model, we analyze the two supply chain contracts under a cooperative relationship in which the manufacturer and supplier cooperatively determine the sharing portion of the revenue or cost.

Combined IOT (internet of things) technology, the technology framework of traceability system including one kernel, two axes and three chains was constructed. One kernel means to implement the goal of agricultural products and food quality safety traceability. Two axes are the supply chain from farm to table as the horizontal axe and the IOT technologies from information sensing, information transmission to intelligent decision as the vertical axe. Three chains include products chain for supply lifecycle, service chain for supply chain actors and technology chain for IOT. Furthermore, the urgent problems for implement the traceability system were put forward, which included unified encoding, low cost and quick information collection equipment, application system with intelligent decision model and collaborative traceability platform."

To this end, a multi-directional local search (MDLS) metaheuristic is developed. The proposed method provides a limited set of non-dominated solutions ranging from a purely cost effective solution to a purely environmentally effective one. Each iteration of the MDLS consists in performing local searches from all non-dominated solutions. To do so, a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm is used. Extensive experiments based on randomly generated instances of various sizes and features are described. Three classic performance measures are used to compare the set of non-dominated solutions obtained by the MDLS algorithm and by directly solving the MILP model with the epsilon-constraint approach.

The synthesis, design and economic aspects of constructing a processing system using this technology are well-developed and have recently reached the stage of industrial implementation. Nonetheless, the early stage of technology development focuses on process and product safety and tends to ignore other risk aspects that are closely associated with the biomass value chain. Due to the complex nature of the biomass value chain, conventional risk mitigation strategies are ineffective in mitigating risks at the management level. More recent approaches, particularly stochastic programming methods, have yielded robust results in addressing technological risks and design uncertainties. However, such approaches are still unable to effectively consider non-quantitative risks such as business risks and regulatory risks. Hence, this study proposes a combined method of an analytical model and stochastic programming approach to prioritize risks and risk mitigation strategies for decision-making purposes. This work presents a novel multiple-criteria decision-making expert system based on fuzzy set theory, which is the Decision and Evaluation-based Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (DEFANP) method. The novel method functions to prioritize risk mitigation strategies within a network relationship of project goals, key components of the biomass industry and industrial stakeholders. As the stochastic risk mitigation counterpart, the fluctuations and uncertainties in operations, transportation, market supply-demand and price are modeled using the Monte Carlo simulation method. From this, risks of implementing biomass polygeneration systems can be mitigated by selecting a strategy that yields the highest analytical indicator while reconciling with the corresponding probabilities of achieving management goals. A palm biomass polygeneration system in Malaysia is presented as case study where the key implementation risks are regulatory risks, financing risks, technology risks, supply chain and feedstock risks, business risks, social and environmental risks."

Intelligent supply chains that are primarily supported by RFID technology can meet these integration needs. By using RFID, a company can benefit from several advantages. One of them is cost reduction and time efficiency. This paper attempts to recommend a model to estimate the benefits of implementing RFID in companies that have an integrated supply chain process.

The smart city has always regarded green and low-carbon development as one of the goals, and the carbon emissions of the auto parts industry cannot be ignored, so we should carry out energy conservation and emission reduction. With the rapid development of the domestic auto parts industry, the number of car ownership has increased dramatically, producing more and more CO2 and waste. Facing the pressure of resources, energy, and environment, the effective and circular operation of the auto parts supply chain under the low-carbon transformation is not only a great challenge, but also a development opportunity. Under the background of carbon emission, this paper establishes a decision-making optimization model of the low-carbon supply chain of auto parts based on carbon emission responsibility sharing and resource sharing. This paper analyzes the optimal decision-making behavior and interaction of suppliers, producers, physical retailers, online retailers, demand markets, and recyclers in the auto parts industry, constructs the economic and environmental objective functions of low-carbon supply chain management, applies variational inequality to analyze the optimal conditions of the whole low-carbon supply chain system, and finally carries out simulation calculation. The research shows that the upstream and downstream auto parts enterprises based on low-carbon competition and cooperation can effectively manage the carbon footprint of the whole supply chain through the sharing of responsibilities and resources among enterprises, so as to reduce the overall carbon emissions of the supply chain system."

To illustrate our proposition, we discuss and contrast recent developments in the Southern California and Vancouver ports with respect to the regulation, integration and governance of port container trucking. The successful accumulation of value within port-related supply chains is increasingly vulnerable to disruption and inefficiency in port trucking. On the west coast of North America, this is due to both labor related issues as well as issues of asset management. In response, governments, port authorities and operators have taken on a more active role in ensuring that the supply chain has adequate equipment and land to deal with significant congestion-related bottlenecks. These actions represent expanded areas of responsibility beyond traditional notions of port governance."

We consider inventory record inaccuracy in a supply chain model, where a Stackelberg manufacturer sets the wholesale price and a retailer determines how much to stock for sale to customers. We first analyze the impact of inventory record inaccuracy on optimal stocking decisions and profits. By contrasting optimal decisions in a decentralized supply chain with those in an integrated supply chain, we find that inventory record inaccuracy exacerbates the inefficiencies resulting from double marginalization in decentralized supply chains. Assuming RFID technology can eliminate the problem of inventory record inaccuracy, we determine the cost thresholds at which RFID adoption becomes profitable. We show that a decentralized supply chain benefits more from RFID technology, such that RFID adoption improves supply chain coordination. © 2007 Production and Operations Management Society."

Greater vaccine thermostability is generally touted as the obvious solution. Despite conventional wisdom, comprehensive analysis of the value proposition for increasing vaccine thermostability has been lacking. Further, while significant investments have been made in increasing vaccine thermostability in recent years, no vaccine products have been commercialized as a result. We analyzed the value proposition for increasing vaccine thermostability, grounding the analysis in specific vaccine use cases (e.g., use in routine immunization [RI] programs, or in campaigns) and in the broader context of cold chain technology and country level supply chain system design. The results were often surprising. For example, cold chain costs actually represent a relatively small fraction of total vaccine delivery system costs. Further, there are critical, vaccine use case-specific temporal thresholds that need to be overcome for significant benefits to be reaped from increasing vaccine thermostability. We present a number of recommendations deriving from this analysis that suggest a rational path toward unlocking the value (maximizing coverage, minimizing total system costs) of increased vaccine thermostability, including: (1) the full range of thermostability of existing vaccines should be defined and included in their labels; (2) for new vaccines, thermostability goals should be addressed up-front at the level of the target product profile; (3) improving cold chain infrastructure and supply chain system design is likely to have the largest impact on total system costs and coverage in the short term-and will influence the degree of thermostability required in the future; (4) in the long term, there remains value in monitoring the emergence of disruptive technologies that could remove the entire RI portfolio out of the cold chain."

Findings: The paper found that partner relationships, information sharing, and supply chain integration can represent the processes through which e-procurement contributes to supply chain performance. Supply chain integration has the highest standardized total effect on supply chain performance. Research limitations/implications: Future studies could more systematically analyze the relationships among e-procurement, supply chain integration and supply chain performance. Cross-level analysis is also worthy of investigation when considering the influence of technology-usage characteristics.

The purpose of this research paper was to examine the multifaceted scope of supply chain with respect to cloud computing, to investigate the performance of a supply chain department that is equipped with cloud-supported supply chain information systems, to understand the sustainability of an organisation driven by the theory of resources based view, and moreover, to explore the controlling influence of management. Methodology: Data was collected from different firms operating in Indonesia using cross sectional analysis. Structural Equation Model has been used to examine the connection between cloud-supported supply chain information system and resulting performance based on proposed prototype. Results: Findings revealed that cloud computing has a very progressive influence on supply chain and that cloud-supported supply chain information systems are positively connected with performance, which ultimately affects an organisation's sustainability. Management influence regulates the association between three core areas, which are performance of supply chain department, suppliers, and internal processes. In addition, management does not have any controlling influence in integrated customer management and related supply chain performance. Repercussions: Considering the advantages of cloud computing with respect to supply chain, as testified in this research paper, there is greater need for managers to recognize that it is now a prerequisite for supply chain departments to have established cloud-supported information systems that will facilitate the enhancement of performance and organisation sustainability. Originality: This study extends upon previous literature, where the impact of information technology on the performance of supply chain departments was gauged but with conflicting results. Cloud computing has been influential in the progression of Information Systems and Communication, whereas incorporating the technology in supply chain is considered bombastic. This research paper attempts to solve this enigma by abstracting the multifaceted scope of supply chain management supported by cloud computing and investigating the manner in which it influences an organisation's supply chain and ecological performance. This research paper is distinct in its incorporation of cloud technology in supply chain. Similarly, the controlling influence of management also contributes to the existing literature on supply chain management."

To respond to Muslim consumers’ trust concerns in Halal food, many traceability systems were proposed in previous studies based on emerging technologies and  recommended to be incorporated into Halal food supply chains. Nevertheless, all of these systems are centralized, opaque and not enough transparent.

Thus, by following the traditional perception, smart contracts target to reduce transaction costs including arbitration and enforcement costs by realising trackable and irreversible transactions by using blockchain technology for distributed databases. However, the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating the entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organisational business-processes that are characteristic for smart supply chains. A closer look to existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to supply chain management, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 solutions. The author participated in several EU projects related to transnational entrepreneurial networks and smart supply chains. Thus, the paper discusses the research question of how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable entrepreneurial activities in smart supply chains. The research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies, which took place in the context of the EU projects with a focus on the Baltic Sea Region."

There have been advances in eco-efficiency through the reduction in energy, water and other resource consumption. Thus, wider sustainability programmes have improved the social and eco-efficiency performance in previously lean operations. Whilst eco-efficiency programmes have enhanced lean supply chains, they have usually been separate rather than integral to day-to-day innovation. Operational metrics deployed typically favour cost, quality and delivery with eco-efficiency being progressed as separate projects. In contrast, the organisation of maintenance to contribute to the sustainability dimension of innovation in supply chain operations is absent in theory and practice despite its inherently complementary role to maintain and enhance the performance of assets. Introducing innovation-led lean activity through maintenance to enhance eco-efficiency offers opportunities for new practices and technology. This paper considers current literature and presents the evolution of an energy efficiency programme into a programme across 11 sites in a lean supply chain supported by maintenance. The novelty is a framework showing how to embed eco-efficiency innovativeness into innovation-led lean operations through maintenance, overcome barriers to implementation and support others through a community of experts."

At the same time the vulnerability of supply chains to disturbance or disruption has increased. It is not only the effect of external events such as wars, strikes or terrorist attacks, but also the impact of changes in business strategy. Many companies have experienced a change in their supply chain risk profile as a result of changes in their business models, for example the adoption of ""lean"" practices, the move to outsourcing and a general tendency to reduce the size of the supplier base.

We find that the elimination of physical menu costs benefits all supply chain stakeholders (retailer, consumers, suppliers). In our setting, daily revenues increased, the average price per unit sold decreased, and daily sales volumes increased as a result of ESLs. We also find that ESL adoption increased price-adjustment volume, decreased the average size of a price adjustment, and decreased the batching of price changes across different products. Finally, we find that ESL adoption had a statistically significant effect on the volume of downward price changes, but not on the volume of upward price changes, which explains the direction of the change in operational outcomes."

To understand radio frequency key points fundamental on that are identified and reviewed. Some applications of radio frequency identification in supply chain are briefly reviewed and five cases of radio frequency identification implementation in supply chain are discussed. Provides key elements of radio frequency identification and the integration of supply chain and radio frequency identification for generating new systems with higher level of profitability, efficiency, and productivity. To make supply chain system functional and successfully operational manufacturers can use radio frequency identification solutions to reduce operating costs through decreasing the labor costs, claims, and returns. This will help them to increase the operating income. They also can reduce working capital by enabling reductions in inventory and lowering the inventory write-off from the return goods and those items that are un-saleable at the end. It is the collection of such strategies that can bring higher level of profitability and productivity to the supply chain. This sophisticated technology is more useful to the management for one or more of the following facts: better supply chain and inventory management; reducing counterfeiting and fraud controlling; tracking work-in progress; reducing administrative errors; reducing rework; better management of warrantee claims; capable of working in suitable and harsh environments; better supply chain efficiency; cost saving and profit enhancement. Due to the fact that a better management of production system is related to the full understanding of the technologies implemented and the system under consideration, sufficient background on the radio frequency identification technology is provided and supply chain management system including profitability and productivity enhancement are discussed."

Decision-makers of all the firms always keep searching different policies such as trade credit, preservation technology. By adopting these policies they help in strengthen the relationship among different players of supply chain. It is also observed that decision-makers develop policies for integrated system under some restrictions such as budget constraint. Infeasible solutions of many real world problems are obtained by ignoring such restriction. On focusing all these issues, in this paper, a multi-item integrated supply chain inventory model is formulated by considering one manufacturer and one retailer over a finite planning horizon. Manufacturer provides trade credit period to its retailer to strengthen the supply chain. It is assumed that the demand is multi-variable which depends on trade credit period and selling price of the items. In a real-life integrated supply chain inventory system, limitations on available budget and storage space are always faced by the manufacturer and the retailer. So, model is formulated to minimize the total integrated cost of the system subject to space and budget constraints. Optimal values of decision variables and objective function is obtained by using Lagrangian Multiplier Method (LMM). Proposed model is illustrated with the help of numerical and sensitive analysis is carried out with respect to different parameters."

Many food companies are now aggressively focusing on logistics management as the last frontier to gain and sustain a competitive advantage. This study describes a model of intelligent food supply chain that improves efficiency within the supply chain. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that agent technology can optimise food supply chains by (a) reviewing intelligent agents applications for supply chain optimisation and (b) illustrating how a multi-agent system can optimise performance of a beverage logistics network. Firstly, we review and synthesise existing applications in comparison to traditional and Internet-based technologies and critically evaluate agent technology applicability for supply chain management. We model the beer supply network to demonstrate that products can acquire intelligence to direct themselves throughout the distribution network. Optimisation agents can help solve specific problems of beverage supply: reduce inventories and lessen bullwhip effect, improve communication, and enable chain coordination without adverse risk sharing. Further, they gain a capability to be purchased and sold while in transit. Overviews of the supporting technologies that make such a supply chain a reality are fully discussed. In particular, optimisation agents have the characteristics of autonomous action, being proactive, reactive, and able to communicate. We demonstrate that agents enhance the flexibility, information visibility, and efficiency of the supply chain management. Suggestions and recommendations for further research are provided. Simulations of the agent-enabled supply optimisation can be used to benchmark for future research and development associated with building an optimisation agent. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Most supply chains are composed of independent agents with individual preferences. It is expected that no single agent has the power to optimise the supply chain. Supply chain management is now seen as a governing element in strategy and as an effective way of creating value for customers. The so-called bullwhip effect, describing growing variation upstream in a supply chain, is probably the most famous demonstration that decentralised decision making can lead to poor supply chain performance. Information asymmetry is one of the most powerful sources of the bullwhip effect. Information sharing of customer demand has an impact on the bullwhip effect. Information technology has lead to centralised information, shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes. The analysis of causes of the bullwhip effect has lead to suggestions for reducing the bullwhip effect in supply chains by strategic partnership. Supply chain partnership leads to increased information flows, reduced uncertainty, and a more profitable supply chain. The cooperation is based on contacts and formal agreements. Information exchange is very important issue for coordinating actions of units. New business practices and information technology make the coordination even closer.

However, there are increasing concerns about conflicts between the supply of rare-earth elements (REs) (mainly neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium) and the global expansion of wind power. Here, we provide a dynamic, technology-rich, and regional-specific approach to exploring such conflicts among ten world regions through 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We find that the significant increase in RE demand driven by the ambitious 2050 global wind-power targets cannot be achieved without 11- to 26-fold expansion in the RE production. Material recycling and efficiency, production expansion, and technical innovation are promising for alleviating RE supply shortages in the long term. However, the existing global RE supply structure, along with the intensifying geopolitical and environmental constraints, could inhibit the rapid expansion of wind power, which calls for global cooperation to foster a sustainable and responsible RE supply chain. In 2019, the United Nations called for more ambitious climate action to prevent catastrophic climate change. Decarbonizing our energy systems is one of the most important actions we can take. In response, many countries have developed ambitious plans to expand wind power. However, wind turbines heavily rely on rare-earth elements (REs), and it remains unclear whether supply can meet demand. We investigated potential conflicts between RE demand and supply across ten global regions up to 2050 under four widely recognized climate scenarios. We found that RE supply capacity to support ambitious system-wide wind-power development is likely to be hindered by the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and intensified geopolitical and environmental constraints, and an 11- to 26-fold increase in production will be necessary to meet ambitious wind-power-expansion targets. To overcome these RE supply challenges, we highlight the importance of facilitating free trade and diversifying RE production via global cooperation. Enhanced climate action is needed, but ambitious global wind-power-expansion targets raise concern regarding potential conflicts between the supply and demand of rare-earth elements (REs). Li et al. explore such conflicts across ten global regions through 2050 under four scenarios. They show that RE supply might not be able to meet ambitious wind-power development given the monopolistic structure of the RE supply chain and escalated geopolitical and environmental constraints. Sustainable and responsible RE supply chains are possible only via global cooperation."

Contractually, the client indicates the duration of the contract and the optimal number of maintenance interventions to maximise asset availability; the vendor quotes the cost for the requested interventions. We study how the initial investment and the contract parameters affect the net present value for each party and the supply chain, demonstrating the existence of an optimal relation between the number of preventive maintenance interventions and level of investment. We derive the optimal contract parameters for the client, vendor and chain and show lack of coordination between the parties.

The same is hypothesized for the associated information flow. However, various factors may create a difference between the actual physical and information system (IS) flows and perturb their synchronized evolution. The implications of such a discrepancy are particularly prevalent in contemporary supply chains, where sales commitments are based on IS records only. In this paper we model and analyze the impact of inventory inaccuracies on supply chain performance. We first provide an overview of potential errors that may occur within an inventory system and we then propose a general framework to model the impact of inaccuracy errors. Potential errors in both the physical and/or the IS record inventories are considered and optimal analytical solutions are provided for both centralized and decentralized (coordinated and uncoordinated) supply chains for three plausible scenarios: inaccuracy errors are ignored; errors are estimated; the utilization of a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology enables the reduction of the relevant errors. The performance improvements enabled by the availability of error related information and the RFID technology are assessed and managerial insights are provided. The paper concludes with the implications of our work for supply chain design as well as with an agenda for further research in this area."

By making use of timestamps we can utilise some major features offered by the Blockchain technology. Like, lastingness, distributed amongst its peers, by making use of these attributes, one can be assured transactions can be made sturdier and more transparent. By design, the Block-chain enforces transparency, security, authenticity, and auditability. When it comes to supply chain management, it could make it easier for big businesses to track all the verifiable details for every single order on the supply chain. As an incorruptible digital ledger, Block-chain could effectively store records for every product. In conclusion, Block-chain has the potential to drive cost-saving efficiencies and enhance the consumer’s experience through transparency, traceability, and trade-ability in various fields of applications like Supply chain management. Nodes of the Block-chain network can generate keys, hashes and transactions blocks.

Supply chain is consisting of activities concerned with the flow and conversion of goods from raw material to finish goods and to the delivery of finish goods to final customer, as well as the associated information flow back in the chain. ICT (Information and communication Technology) including hardware and software has lead to massive opportunities to supply chain and fostering it to grow at even more speed. In SCM, information plays an important role as it drives the whole supply chain system. It has become evident that a supply chain that transfer materials and information smoothly can become a market differentiator and the ultimate winner in competition. IT based supply chain management systems improves supply chain integration and make efficient flow of market information and goods throughout the chain. This study reviews the modern technology and use of emerging supply chain software solutions provided by software manufacturing vendors.

The expected rapid increase in batteries could result in new resource challenges and supply-chain risks. To strengthen the resilience and sustainability of automotive supply chains and reduce primary resource requirements, circular economy strategies are needed. Here we illustrate how these strategies can reduce the extraction of primary raw materials, that is, cobalt supplies. Material flow analysis is applied to understand current and future flows of cobalt embedded in electric vehicle batteries across the European Union. A reference scenario is presented and compared with four strategies: technology-driven substitution and technology-driven reduction of cobalt, new business models to stimulate battery reuse/recycling and policy-driven strategy to increase recycling. We find that new technologies provide the most promising strategies to reduce the reliance on cobalt substantially but could result in burden shifting such as an increase in nickel demand. To avoid the latter, technological developments should be combined with an efficient recycling system. We conclude that more-ambitious circular economy strategies, at both government and business levels, are urgently needed to address current and future resource challenges across the supply chain successfully."

In total, 20 technology transfer critical barriers have been identified from literature review and categorized in to six criteria. In second stage, analytics hierarchy process has been utilized to rank the critical barriers of technology transfer in supply chain and provide a benchmarking framework. Findings - Political barriers (PB) have been analyzed most significant criteria of critical barriers to technology transfer followed by socio-cultural barriers (SO) and economic barriers (EB). “Political instability,” “Difficulty in transfer and diffusion,” “Too expensive,” “Inappropriate/incompetent technology and resource wastage in technologies imported,” “Inactive role of SC members and resistance to change” and “Management attitude” have been found most hindering barrier in their respective category/criterion of technology transfer barriers.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The theoretical model proposed in this paper is contrasted using structural equation modelling of the retail distribution channel for home appliances. Findings: The research shows that there is no positive direct relationship between the specific use of ITs and the retailer's perceived performance in the relationship with the provider. The results do, however, provide evidence for a positive indirect relationship through both information sharing and satisfaction obtained from the relationship with the provider. Research Limitations: The analysis has been developed from the retail perspective. We suggest that future research focus on the retailer's and the provider's perspectives. Practical Implications: In the context of SCM, the competitive advantages achieved through IT use derive from a better network of relationships between the firms involved as a result of greater information quality and information sharing. Specific use of ITs stimulates greater information sharing between retailer and provider and thus greater satisfaction and better perceived performance of the retailer in the relationship with the provider.

The aim of this study was to clarify the ideas of short food supply chains (SFSCs) and the organic production of food products and to indicate how economic benefits can be achieved in individual markets. The identified research gaps include the lack of a strong theoretical basis, as well as the lack of empirical studies concerning the multi-objective optimization of the economic effects of producers using computer simulation methods. However, the aim of this research was to identify the activities within such structures that can produce economic effects and influence the competences and soft relationships between the organizations participating in the chains. The adopted research methods included a critical analysis of the literature and the use of information technology tools and computer simulation. We found that computer simulation methods can lead to better decisions (to increase manufacturer benefits) regarding how to service selected markets within the SFSC.

The supply chain consists all the activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from the raw material stage, through to the end user, as well as the associated information flows. Supply Chain Management is a set of synchronized decision & activities, utilized to effectively integrate suppliers, manufacturers, transporters, warehouses, retailers & customers so that the right product or service is distributed at the right quantities, to the proper locations & at the appropriate time, in order to minimize system wide costs while satisfying customer service level requirements. Information Technology application has brought enormous opportunities to supply chain management and making it grow at an even faster pace. Role of information is crucial & drives the entire supply chain system. For many companies, it has become clear that a supply chain that flows information and material effectively can be a significant differentiator, the competitive winner. Supply chain management system can be regarded as a type of distributed information management system, of which agent technology provides the ultimate in its development.

The risk of supply disruptions to these resources has been widely observed and measured. However, system boundaries of previous studies were conventionally limited to the mine stage. Possible supply risks inherent in the downstream processing stages were not adequately taken into account. To fill this gap, we generalize the idea of supply risk to the whole supply chain to describe the comprehensive threats for the steady consumption of lithium-ion batteries. Based on such concept, this study assesses the risks of the lithium-ion battery related materials in the three major stages of the entire supply chain: mining, refining and manufacturing. Results indicate that lithium and cobalt are the most critical materials for lithium-ion battery industry. Risks hidden in the downstream stages of nickel and manganese should also not be overlooked. We further argue that for important energy-related materials with complicated supply chains, the risks should be identified and safeguarded comprehensively throughout the entire supply chain. Such work calls for further database establishment and analysis."

The reduction of food waste impacts positively all three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental). Thirty-three challenges inhibiting reduction of waste in AFSC are identified by a review of the literature and a consultation with experts in the Indian food industry and academia. These challenges are grouped using Exploratory Factor Analysis into a super-set of nine challenges. The inter-relationship and respective dominance among these nine challenges is then determined using Interpretive Structural Modelling and MICMAC analysis. The group of independent challenges (food characteristics, supply chain uncertainty, market infrastructure, and food policy and regulation) have higher driving power and low dependency, and require maximum attention. These four challenges constrain decisions at the three-decision-making echelon (strategic, tactical, and operational) and each of the supply-chain echelons. The group of dependent challenges (supply chain partnerships, operational capability, and supply chain networks) have high dependence and low driving power and are resultant effects. The challenge, information technology, with high driving and dependence power, is a linkage variable. It acts as an enabler of dependent variables, and it mitigates the complexities due to food characteristics and uncertainty. The challenge, consumer behaviour, with low driving and dependence power, is an autonomous variable. It has little influence on waste reduction in Indian AFSC. This study highlights the importance of conducting region-specific study of supply chains and promotes sustainable practice."

With computer-aided self-learning capability, we simulate three models for manual-, barcode-, and RFID-enabled precast construction supply chain. The results of 100 precast wall-panel construction in a two-echelon precast construction supply chain reveal that the knowledge-based RFID system could generate 62.0% saving of operational costs, which is 29.0% higher than that of a barcode-based system. As a result, the computer-aided adaptive learning mechanism based on RFID is verifiable to improve the overall operational performance by reducing lead time, operational errors, and costs. Due to the lack of existing literature of data technology utilization in the precast construction industry, our findings in this research could improve the decision making regarding technology selection, as well as help with the operationalization of RFID and transformation to intelligent precast construction management in big data environment."

During distribution, food is exposed to various risks, such as inadequate storage or failure to keep a certain temperature, which consequently affects food integrity. This paper explains the procedures distributors are implementing to guarantee food safety, food quality and overall food integrity in the supply chain. Methods: This paper involves a qualitative study approach. Face to face interviews were conducted in the four (4) leading logistics companies in the cold chain segment, which provide logistics solutions, from delivery of the goods from the manufacturing company to the point of sale. Results: In order to ensure that high quality products are transported properly, and risks are managed effectively, the companies operate in accordance with the principles of different standards. They have work procedures within each activity in the food supply chain to avoid the distortion of food quality and product safety. The whole process of food transport is followed by IT technology, and food categories are divided into nine groups according to the required prescribed temperature. As special requirements need to be respected during the handling of sensitive products, the investigated companies point out the importance of investing in their employees. Conclusions: Food integrity is a holistic concept that relates to food production and distribution, safety and quality. The food supply chain, which tends to be long, global and highly interconnected, leading to greater risk exposure, requires temperature monitoring at every link in the supply chain, particularly in the warehouse and transportation vehicles. Special emphasis on the role of IT and employees is given."

Decision-makers have to address this novelty (usually named as Industry 4.0) and try to develop appropriate information systems, physical facilities, and different kind of technologies capable of meeting the future needs of economy. As a consequence, there is a need for new paradigms of the way freight is move, store, realize, and supply through the world (logistics system). One of the proposed solutions is the Physical Internet, concept of open global logistics system which completely redefines current supply chain configuration, business models, and value-creation patterns.However, further detailed research on this topic is much needed. This paper aims to provide a balanced review of the variety of views considered among professionals in the field of Physical Internet with the final aim to identify the biggest challenges (technological, societal, business paradigm) of proposed new logistics paradigm as a practical solution in supporting Industry 4.0."

Large companies are of great significance in this process; agricultural holdings are very important in Russian agricultural business. Unfortunately, the Russian agribusiness sector is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, namely, concurrent enterprises, farms, small businesses in rural areas. They produce and market agricultural products. Therefore, supply chain management in agricultural business requires digitalization and the use of flexible management methods. The purpose of the research is to study agile supply chain management methods in agricultural business. We have considered such flexible methods as a digital platform and a blockchain technology, which contribute to the partnership between small and medium-sized agrifood enterprises by creating a digital network platform for all parties interested in the agricultural product. These methods are more productive compared to the traditional approaches; they provide more efficient interaction between manufacturers, consumers and intermediaries in the flow of goods and services through the supply chain. Unfortunately, agile supply chain management in the agricultural business of Russia has not been widely introduced yet, which makes it difficult to collect analytical information. We believe that this may be explained by the predominance of small and medium-sized enterprises in the country, the lack of digital platforms that act as intermediaries in the supply chain to connect crop producers and consumers."

Management of prefabricated component (PC) suppliers plays a key role in the performance of prefabricated construction project (PCP). Evaluating and improving supplier management maturity (SMM) become critical issues for large contractors. Previous research on PCP supply chain mainly focused on technology, process and performance aspects, while paying little attention to supplier relationship management. This study proposes an assessment criteria system of supplier management from five dimensions, including procurement process, operation efficiency, relationship coordination and strategy alignment and corporate social responsibility. A maturity grid with five levels is designed to present continuous improvement of supplier management. 34 large PCP construction firms listed in contractor directory were investigated in China through semi-structured interview and questionnaire survey. Independent two-samples t-test and one-way analysis of variance were adopted to explore SMM of different groups according to business scope, procurement method and construction experience. The results indicate that the overall maturity level of supplier management is relatively low, implying that supply activity cannot achieve inter-organization integration. Management on relationship coordination and strategy alignment lag behind procurement management and operation efficiency. Single business contractors have higher SMM than diversified ones. Contractors integrated in engineering, procurement and construction are superior to design-bid-build contractors in supplier management, especially in relationship coordination and strategic alignment. Construction experience is conductive to supplier operation efficiency. Noticeably, there are no statistically significant differences in the performance of corporate social responsibility among different groups. These results will contribute to developing a benchmark framework for contractors to evaluate SMM and achieve continuous improvements in PCP."

The study also aims to investigate the role of various factors that possibly mediate the relationship between blockchain-based supply chain management and supply chain integration. The study adopted a twofold mixed-method approach-sequential explanatory- to attain the objectives. In the first phase, data were collected from Malaysian electrical and electronic firms, and by applying PLS-SEM, hypothesized relationships were examined. In the second phase, through a qualitative study, the results of the first phase are discussed with the industry experts to seek their expert opinion. In doing so, the semi-structured interview from seven experts, selected through purposive sampling, were conducted. The findings of both inquiries reveal that blockchain technology has significant potential to enhance the integration between numerous actors in multi-level supply chains while ensuring the transparency and traceability in the transactions. Moreover, the findings reveal that certain pre-requisites are missing at the moment in the Malaysian manufacturing sector, which are inevitable to be met, before implementing the block-chain based supply chain. Sophisticated infrastructure which could suffice the blockchain-based technologies implementation in supply chains and the absorptive capacity is prominent amongst them. Consequently, it is recommended that appropriate training should be given to employees in order to cater to the requirement of the technical skills needed to handle such advanced technology. Further, continuous infrastructural investments should be made to implement blockchain-based technology in the business ecosystem of Malaysia at the government level."

IoT typically integrates supply chain activities to enhance green supply chain performance (GSCP). Since every organization has different IoT capabilities in comparison with other organizations, GSCP can enable supply chain integration activities for enhanced performance. The implementation of an IoT system can reduce the consumption of organizational resources like energy, electricity, and time and can increase the operational speed to gain better logistics and, ultimately, improved supply chain performance. This study has developed and empirically tested the relationship between IoT capabilities, energy consumption behavior (ECB), supply chain integration, green training (GT), and supply chain practices. Such a multidisciplinary relationship has not previously been established in the literature. The proposed study can fulfill the literature gap and opens new horizons for interdisciplinary research. Data used in this study are collected through offline and online survey methods. A total number of 250 out of 400 respondents participated in the survey. Data has been analyzed through partial least square-structure equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results of this study empirically test the developed model. IoT has a positive effect on supplier integration (SI), and customer integration (CI). Furthermore, SI and CI have a mediating role between IoT and GSCP, and GT has a positive impact on GSCP. It is concluded that the implementation of IoT can integrate CI and SI to increase GSCP. GT and ECB can ultimately improve GSCP. Additionally, the use of technology and GT can motivate employees to save energy and protect the environment to increase GSCP."

A combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies provides this research with validity and reliability. Lean principles are found applicable to both residential building projects and many other types of construction projects. It is also found that lean construction can be enhanced if it synergizes with supply chain collaboration. Another finding is that lean management has a significant impact on project performance. Nowadays, construction pursues best lean practices through both learning from manufacturing and developing its own paths. Similar to manufacturing, more and more construction projects adopt industrialised and standardised production and lean management with supply chain collaboration to become leaner. On the other hand, construction-specific management approaches and information technology (IT) tools are increasingly used in lean construction practices to maximise value and minimise waste."

(2004) to reframe the conversation from the direct performance impacts of IT resources and investments to how and why IT shapes higher-order process capabilities that create performance gains for firms. We draw on the emerging IT-enabled organizational capabilities perspective to suggest that firms that develop IT infrastructure integration for SCM and leverage it to create a higher-order supply chain integration capability generate significant and sustainable performance gains. A research model is developed to investigate the hierarchy of IT-related capabilities and their impact on firm performance. Data were collected from 110 supply chain and logistics managers in manufacturing and retail organizations. Our results suggest that integrated IT infrastructures enable firms to develop the higher-order capability of supply chain process integration. This capability enables firms to unbundle information flows from physical flows, and to share information with their supply chain partners to create information-based approaches for superior demand planning, for the staging and movement of physical products, and for streamlining voluminous and complex financial work processes. Furthermore, IT-enabled supply chain integration capability results in significant and sustained firm performance gains, especially in operational excellence and revenue growth. Managerial initiatives should be directed at developing an integrated IT infrastructure and leveraging it to create process capabilities for the integration of resource flows between a firm and its supply chain partners."

The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of digitisation on procurement and its role within the area of supply chain management. The research will also explore potential barriers to digitising procurement and supply chains and ways to overcome them. Finally, the significance of potential enabling technologies to the digitisation will also be examined. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approached utilising an online survey was used to collect the primary data for this study. Data were collected from 414 participants directly involved with procurement or related business functions and work for different organisations in different industries. The survey included eight items about the impact of digitisation on organisational performance in the area of procurement and supply chains; ten items related to key barriers to digitisation of organisations and ways to overcome them; and seven items about enabling technologies to leverage procurement procedures and processes digitisation. All of these items utilised the Likert five-point level of agreement scale. Findings: The findings indicate that digitisation of procurement process can yield several benefits including: supporting daily business and administrative tasks, supporting complex decision-making processes, procurement will become more focussed on strategic decisions and activities, procurement will become a strategic interface to support organisational efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability, and supporting the creation of new business models, products, and services. The authors were also able to confirm that there are barriers to digitising procurement process and supply chains and such barriers found in existing procedures, processes, capacities, and capabilities. Finally, the significance of a number of enabling technologies to the digitisation process was revealed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with participants located world-wide. Industry 4.0 as a topic had been explored within different business areas and functions but very limited research specifically explored potential impact, barriers, and enabling technologies of procurement 4.0.

This SCOR model is actually a reference model standardized terminology and processes [42] which actually emphasizes on benchmarking. This benchmarking is actually related to an operational measurement in order to craft a portfolio for improvement which is directly linked and tied with balance sheet of the company for improved performance along with bottom line increment.

However, since environmental protection is of concern to the public, a green supply chain, because of its minimum effect on nature, has been seriously considered as a solution to this concern. This paper addresses the modeling and solving of a supply chain design for annual cost minimization, while considering environmental effects. This paper considers the cost elements of the supply chain, such as transportation, holding and backorder costs, and also, the environmental effect components of the supply chain, such as the amount of NO2, CO and volatile organic particles produced by facilities and transportation in the supply chain. Considering these two components (cost and environmental effects), we propose a multi-objective optimization problem. In this model, the facilities and transportation options have a capacity constraint and, at each level of the chain, we have several transportation options with different costs. We utilize a memetic algorithm in combination with the Taguchi method to solve this complex model. We also propose a novel decoding method and priority based algorithm for coding the solution chromosome. The performance of the proposed solution method has been examined against the hybrid genetic Taguchi algorithm (GATA) on a set of numeric instances, and results indicate that the proposed method can effectively provide better results than previous solution procedures. © 2012 Sharif University of Technology.

Therefore, the organization and coordination of the supply chain must take into account both energy saving and emission reduction and intelligent decision-making effects. This paper establishes a basic decision-making model for the supply chain under the carbon tax constraint and compares and analyzes the optimal decision-making problem of the supply chain between the centralized and decentralized decisions of producers and retailers under the carbon tax constraint. Then, the supply chain optimization under the three conditions of considering the repurchase contract, the subsidy policy and the joint strategy of both the repurchase and the subsidy under the constraint of carbon tax are discussed. Research shows that carbon tax can play a role in reducing carbon emissions, but for some industries with smaller profit margins, relying solely on carbon tax policy may lead to reduced benefits and make business development difficult. Therefore, considering the combined strategy of repurchase and subsidy at the same time, the dual goals of emission reduction and economic benefits can be achieved."

Second, there is chain law analysis proper as an emerging field in legal studies. Finally, there is a body of literature addressing the interactions between “public” and “private” regulation. In this article, I go beyond these approaches. I argue that, first, other-thanlaw components of a supply chain, such as technology, also exercise normative power and increase legal complexity inherent in chains. I suggest that the concept of infrastructure as developed in science and technology studies helps us to analyse the interaction of legal and non-legal chain components.

We offer insights about this challenge based on a multiyear, multiphase study with nearly 1,000 households in the Indian Himalayas. In phase I, we combined desk reviews, simulations, and focus groups to diagnose barriers to ICS adoption. In phase II, we implemented a set of pilots to simulate a mature market and designed an intervention that upgraded the supply chain (combining marketing and home delivery), provided rebates and financing to lower income and liquidity constraints, and allowed households a choice among ICS. In phase III, we used findings from these pilots to implement a field experiment to rigorously test whether this combination of upgraded supply and demand promotion stimulates adoption. The experiment showed that, compared with zero purchase in control villages, over half of intervention households bought an ICS, although demand was highly price-sensitive. Demand was at least twice as high for electric stoves relative to biomass ICS. Even among households that received a negligible price discount, the upgraded supply chain alone induced a 28 percentage-point increase in ICS ownership. Although the bundled intervention is resource-intensive, the full costs are lower than the social benefits of ICS promotion. Our findings suggest that market analysis, robust supply chains, and price discounts are critical for ICS diffusion."

This article aims to examine the challenges of supply chain management and to propose a triple-C (cease-control-combine) remedy for the North American auto industry's supply chain management. The authors applied management theories, collected information from managers at different levels of the auto industry's supply chain management, and developed a novel theoretical model of sustainability in supply chain management for the auto industry. It is argued that outsourcing to low cost countries – the current supply chain strategy – is not only unsustainable but also irresponsible for the auto industry and society. A triple-C (cease-control-combine) remedy is proposed for the auto industry's supply chain management. The proposed triple-C strategy will save the auto industry money in R&D investment, reduce quality cost and inventory waste, help the industry go through the volatile economy, and achieve sustainable development. With close relationships and strong supports from suppliers, the industry can speed up technology development, introduce new gas efficiency models quickly, and become less dependent on gas price. Finally, the triple-C strategy will help the industry keep jobs and generate new jobs in the USA. These activities lead to public support and restored corporate image.

This paper fills this gap in the literature by analysing firms’ eco-innovation investment strategy in a supply chain with a buyer and two suppliers in the presence of knowledge spillovers and technology gaps among suppliers. To encourage improvements in the eco-innovation performance of suppliers, the buyer allocates a greater market share to the supplier with the lower wholesale price. Both suppliers decide whether to determine their eco-innovation levels unilaterally (Noncooperative innovation strategy) or coordinate in an innovation alliance (Innovation alliance strategy). To determine the relative efficiency of the two innovation schemes, we study a game theoretical model that captures the interactions among three parties. It is demonstrated that knowledge spillovers and technology gaps have a significant impact on suppliers’ eco-innovation levels, the economic benefits, and the total social welfare. We also identify the conditions under which an innovation alliance is better than noncooperative innovation from the perspectives of both the suppliers and social welfare. In particular, both suppliers choose to formalize an innovation alliance under a low-level technology gap, and social welfare benefits more under an innovation alliance than under noncooperative innovation."

The research model relating the programs to support and enhance PR is tested using the High-Performance Manufacturing survey database of 330 plants (3 sectors, 16 countries) and CB-SEM with latent variables. First, RT, MS and TM together form SRS, with a significant impact on PR. Second, when theorizing for mediation processes, SCM intervenes the relationship between the SRS program and PR. Third, the intervening role of SCM is also confirmed by testing for mediation processes. Fourth, environmental complexity interacts with the SRS program in its relationship with SCM. Research implications are twofold: (1) more responsive plants need a more holistic view in which SCM must be deployed in conjunction with SRS; and (2) SCM supports the execution of SRS by playing a key role in improving PR, even when contextual factors are present. Applied implications are that plants can achieve greater responsiveness if they match their production resources around RT through SRS programs. Further, due to SCM's intervening role, SC practitioners should link SCM dimensions to SRS to improve PR.

Technically, blockchain is a decentralized and distributed database where information can be securely recorded. Blockchain-based traceability solutions can tackle the shortcomings of centralized traceability solutions. Firms have already started incorporating blockchain into their supply chain activities in order to improve the transparency through tracking and tracing the events. This paper ultimately aims to present an overview of the various blockchain-based traceability solutions reported in the literature. Primarily, this work provides an insight on the possibilities of blockchain traceability solutions in making a supply chain transparent. Apart from this, it analyses how blockchain traceability solutions affect the visibility of various supply chain distribution network designs, and gives an outline on how technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and smart contracts elevate the opportunities of blockchain.

The leading causes are Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU Fishing) linked to illegal labor. EU and the US have set up the fisheries policy that emphasis on traceability. The traceability principle is to monitor the entire seafood supply chain (Sea to Table). FAO’s technology gap analysis reveals that there is a lack of reliable and affordable automated systems or a lack of links to traceability. The challenge of traceability is tracing back to the catch source with existing data and technology. This study aims at the novel concept of a combination of global and local features of trajectory data for fishing vessel behavior identification and enabling seafood transparency. We present a new technique on a local feature of time series and transform the trajectory pattern to global features for Deep Learning. We apply this technique to AIS and VMS data of Thai fishing vessels (Surrounding Nets, Trawl, Longliner, and Reefer). Fishing vessel behaviors were classified as Fishing, Non-fishing, and Transshipment. Our proposed method gives a robust average accuracy result (97.50%). This concept could solve the IUU Fishing and enable traceability at sea, including monitoring, maritime, and marine resources conservation systems."

Therefore, this research aims to investigate risks in blood supply chain by using a proactive risk management tool called ‘house of risk’ (HOR) model, in order to conduct risk assessment and evaluate risk management actions. A case study of blood supply chain risk management was analyzed, and the HOR model was incorporated to appraise the appropriate actions in the real situation. The results indicate that there are 30 risk events and 16 risk agents identified and assessed in the case study. The outcomes point out that lack of collaboration, insufficient information for decision-making, and limited information sharing are the top 3 risk agents that contribute to significant impact on blood supply chain management. Risk mitigation and management actions were evaluated and the results show that enhancing the collaboration is the most proactive action to manage risks in the blood service operations, followed by information sharing, and demand and supply statistical analysis.

To curb greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government has launched restrict regulatory system and imposed the energy consumption constraint in the textile industry to guarantee the achievability of low carbon economy. The authors aim to examine how the energy consumption constraint affects the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and address the supply chain coordination issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct two case studies from Chinese textile companies and examine the impact of energy consumption constraints on their production and operations management. Based on the real industrial practices, the authors then develop a simple analytical model for a low carbon supply chain in which it consists of one single retailer and one single manufacturer, and the manufacturer determines the choice of clean technology for energy efficiency improvement and emission reduction. Findings: From the case studies, the authors find that the textile companies develop clean technologies to reduce carbon emission in production process under the energy consumption enforcement. In this analytical model, the authors derive the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and reveal that supply chain coordination can be achieved if the manufacturer properly sets the reservation wholesale price (WS) despite the production capacity can fulfill partial market demand under a WS (or cost sharing) contract. The authors also find that the cost-sharing contract may induce the manufacturer to increase the investment of clean technology and reduce the optimal WS.

This involves long transport distances of foods to reach consumers. In the case of local foods, supply chains are shorter. Based on a case study of five local foods producer's supply of their products to a common retailer, the supply chain of local foods is modelled conceptually and modes of development are pointed out based on contingency theory and supply chain management literature. Findings reveal that since these chains are transparent, reciprocal interdependency is abundant mainly because human perception creates a sufficient understanding of the operations management issues pertinent within this simple inter-organisational structure. Local foods supply chains are similar to service supply chains. This includes that both are short in nature and associated with bi-directional interaction between the customer and supplier. Developing short supply chains in local foods supply is associated with improving the exchange economy found in short supply chains. This also implies that development of local foods supply is associated with two paths which may be complementary.

Possible risk and challenges related to the technology were identified and found that without a well-planned policy, the blockchain technology may not always lead to a socio-economic benefit. From implementing the blockchain technology as a means of managing the supply chain, we can expect to have a full transparency over the whole supply chain. Also, its application on the public sectors and on under-developed countries has the potentials to root out corruptions and lift those countries out of poverty. Despite the potential opportunities, this paper found that the blockchain technology is not a panacea that will resolve all corruption issues today. Without considering the data governance and privacy issues, its application on the supply chain may lead to a distorted market structure. Its implementation on the developing or under-developed world will not be realized on a large scale anytime soon due to the resistance of the existing leadership and lack of infrastructure. Blockchain is still a black box for most stakeholders and, therefore, a holistic and coordinated effort will be necessary. We believe that international organizations are suitable to bringing all stakeholders including the government, business and academia together to come up with an effective policy guideline on the blockchain usage. At the same time, more experiment and innovative use cases should be encouraged and developed from the market side. Entrepreneurs should have the incentives to seize new blockchain-related business opportunities and their continuous efforts will ultimately take integrity to higher standards."

This leads to the formation of a global reverse supply chain (GRSC) of solid waste. In this paper, we investigate the design of such a GRSC with a special emphasis on three aspects; (1) uncertainty of waste collection levels, (2) associated carbon emissions, and (3) challenges posed by the supply chain's global aspect, particularly the maritime transportation costs and currency exchange rates. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to integrate the three above-mentioned important aspects in the design of a GRSC. We have used mixed integer-linear programming method along with robust optimization to develop the model which is validated using a sample case study of e-waste management. Our results show that using a robust model by taking the complex interactions characterizing global reverse supply chain networks into account, we can create a better GRSC.

The Internet of Things (IoT), and in particular Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, can be used to realize these goals. For product identification, tracking and real-time awareness, RFID tags are attached to goods. As tagged goods move along the supply chain from the suppliers to the manufacturers, and then on to the retailers until eventually they reach the customers, two major security challenges can be identified: (I) to protect the shipment of goods that are controlled by potentially untrusted carriers; and (II) to secure the transfer of ownership at each stage of the chain. For the former, grouping proofs in which the tags of the scanned goods generate a proof of “simulatenous” presence can be employed, while for the latter, ownership transfer protocols (OTP) are used. This paper describes enhanced security solutions for both challenges.

Supply chains are as important to customers as the product itself. However, customers are not always provided a clear view of the entire supply chain for goods. To remediate this issue, technology in the form of blockchains can be used to tie the history of a product through its associated supply chain. The idea of using blockchain as a tool for supply chain has recently become more prevalent given the publicity of cryp-tocurrencies like bitcoin. Integrating blockchain into supply chain management allows organizations to develop, produce and purchase products and services with increased efficiency and a reduction in fraud. This, in turn, means that consumers and investors can have faith in the goods and services they purchase.

This form of management works to develop efficiencies within the marketplace by centrally controlling production, shipment and distribution of a product or service. This allows for trans-parency across all levels of a product or service for a producer and supplier. Supply chains are made up of a network of in-dividuals, organizations, technology, resources and activities that spread from the initial creation of a product to delivery. Blockchains are a secure digital ledger that records crypto-currency transactions in a series of blocks. An individual block maintains a timestamp to record the transaction, known as a cryptographic hash. To process these cryptographic hashes, a network of computers works to solve computationally difficult puzzles, and the first participant to solve the problem gets to add their hash to the blockchain and claim credit, or mine cryptocurrency, for processing. Through this process of min-ing, the collection of timestamped blocks is added together to form the blockchain. These blocks are maintained across several computers or nodes. Although several timestamps and transactions occur on a block, the information cannot be altered or removed after it has been added to the blockchain, nor can entries be forged. This allows for a level of transparency and permanency in terms of an information trail."

And third, to describe the current state of RFID technology and to give practical information for managers in the healthcare sector to make sound decisions about the possible implementation of RFID technology within their organizations. Design/methodology/approach: Healthcare industry literature was reviewed and examples of specific instances of RFID implementation were examined using an integrated simulation model developed with Excel, @Risk and Visio software tools. Findings: Analysis showed that the cost of implementing current RFID technology is too expensive for broad and sweeping implementation within the healthcare sector at this time. However, several example applications have been identified in which this technology can be effectively leveraged in a cost-effective way. Practical implications: This study shows that RFID technology has come a long way in the recent past and has potential to improve healthcare sector productivity and efficiency. Implementation by large companies such as Wal-mart has helped to make the technology become much more economical in its per unit cost as well as its supporting equipment and training costs. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in the idea that few practical and pragmatic approaches have been taken within the academic field of study for the implementation of RFID into the healthcare supply chain. Much of the research has focused on specific companies or portions of the supply chain and not the entire supply chain. Also, many of the papers have discussed the future of the supply chain that is heavily dependent on advances in RFID technology.

In recent years, the rise of intelligent technology has had a great impact on the supply chain of new energy vehicles, which, coupled with the complexity of the supply chain itself, puts it at great risk. Therefore, it is quite indispensable to evaluate the risk of the new energy vehicle supply chain. This paper assesses the risks faced by China's new energy vehicle supply chain in this period of technological transformation. First of all, this paper establishes an evaluation criteria system of 16 sub-criterion related to three dimensions: the market risk, operational risk, and the environmental risk. Then, variable weight theory is proposed to modify the constant weight obtained by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). Finally, a risk assessment of China's new energy vehicle supply chain is carried out by combining the variable weight and the cloud model. This method can effectively explain the randomness of matters, and avoid the influence of value abnormality on the criteria system. The results show that China's new energy vehicle supply chain is at a high level. Through the identification of risk factors, mainly referring to the low clustering risk, technical level risk and information transparency risk, this paper can provide a risk prevention reference for corresponding enterprises."

Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder’s interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. “Digital” savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data."

This paper uses a game theory approach to investigate this strategy of a manufacturer under a closed-loop supply chain consisting of one supplier, one manufacturer, and one third-party remanufacturer (TPR), with the consideration of customer environmental awareness. In particular, the supplier supplies the components to the manufacturer and the manufacturer adopts technology licensing remanufacturing via the TPR.We explicitly characterize the reactions between the supplier and the manufacturer as being in equilibrium after adopting the technology licensing. We find that only when remanufacturing is a potential threat to the supplier is the performance of the supply chain improved and the double marginalization effect effectively eliminated. Moreover, remanufacturing by technology licensing only increases the profit of the manufacturer, but decreases the profit of the supplier. Interestingly, contrary to traditional wisdom, the existence of remanufactured products does not reduce the quantity of new products. Furthermore, remanufacturing by technology licensing may not always improve the environment, but customers in the market have environmental awareness that facilitates remanufacturing."

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative approach, using document analysis and in-depth interviews with industry specialists. Findings: Ultra-fast fashion differs from fast in the following supply chain strategies: avoids any excess inventory, focuses on local manufacturing, on-demand production, and shorter lead times from a few days to a week with a combination of agile, lean, responsive supply chain strategies. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are due to the cut-off period and the use of a restricted sample. As implications, technological capabilities are underexplored in the fashion industry. Although important to the traditional and fast fashion industry, technology is viewed as a tool and not as a capability that can generate competitive advantage. This paper addresses technology as capabilities to make ultra-fast fashion retailers more competitive. Practical implications: Ultra-fast fashion could potentially impact current fast fashion retailers to partially move their business model and operations towards an ultra-fast approach. Fast fashion retailers desiring to speed up their production processes launch more weekly collections to cater to consumers who are more fashion-conscious.

The effects of said disruptions and breaches on e-commerce businesses under varied disruption conditions are still uncertain. Furthermore, the effect of security breaches on nonparticipating members of the supply chain is poorly understood, especially under various disruption profiles. Using discrete event modeling, in this article, we explore the impact of disruption caused by information security breaches on supply chain performance and the externality effect of partial integration on nonparticipants. We also examine the impact of breach disruption frequency and remediation length on supply chain performance with varying levels of information sharing. These impacts were studied under two typical inventory replenishment policies for SMEs. It was determined that remediation length should be a prioritized factor in impact management and that flexibility in the inventory replenishment policy can help mitigate the impact of information disruption on the inventory performance of businesses, especially that of nonparticipants, in information-sharing partnerships."

This paper examines the relative costs of carbon mitigation from a life cycle perspective for 12 different hydrogen production techniques using fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable sources by technology substitution. Production costs and life cycle emissions are parameterized and re-estimated from currently available assessments to produce robust ranges to describe uncertainties for each technology. Hydrogen production routes are then compared using a combination of metrics, levelized cost of carbon mitigation and the proportional decarbonization benchmarked against steam methane reforming, to provide a clearer picture of the relative merits of various hydrogen production pathways, the limitations of technologies and the research challenges that need to be addressed for cost-effective decarbonization pathways. The results show that there is a trade-off between the cost of mitigation and the proportion of decarbonization achieved. The most cost-effective methods of decarbonization still utilize fossil feedstocks due to their low cost of extraction and processing, but only offer moderate decarbonisation levels due to previous underestimations of supply chain emissions contributions. Methane pyrolysis may be the most cost-effective short-term abatement solution, but its emissions reduction performance is heavily dependent on managing supply chain emissions whilst cost effectiveness is governed by the price of solid carbon. Renewable electrolytic routes offer significantly higher emissions reductions, but production routes are more complex than those that utilise naturally-occurring energy-dense fuels and hydrogen costs are high at modest renewable energy capacity factors. Nuclear routes are highly cost-effective mitigation options, but could suffer from regionally varied perceptions of safety and concerns regarding proliferation and the available data lacks depth and transparency. Better-performing fossil-based hydrogen production technologies with lower decarbonization fractions will be required to minimise the total cost of decarbonization but may not be commensurate with ambitious climate targets."

A Stackelberg game approach employed to solve four retailer and manufacturer low-carbon strategy combinations, after which these strategies are further analyzed using an evolutionary theoretical game approach, from which an evolutionary stability strategy (ESS)is determined. The ESS indicated that: 1)in the low-carbon technology development stage, only one player (the manufacturer or the retailer)should employ low-carbon behavior; and 2)in the advanced low-carbon technology stage, only the retailer should employ low-carbon behavior. These positive results achieved economic, environmental and social Pareto improvements that complied with the government low-carbon requirements, catered to the low-carbon consumer demand, and improved supply chain economic and environmental performances. Finally, the impact of the changes from the government low-carbon policies, consumer sensitivities, and retailer carbon financing interest/subsidy rates on the ESS were analyzed, from which it was found: 1)the government could encourage enterprises to reduce carbon emissions by controlling carbon prices rather than imposing a carbon cap; 2)the enterprises need to focus on consumer sensitivities as the increase of these will reduce the long-term operational carbon emissions; and 3)retailers could stabilize the evolutionary supply chain system by lowering the carbon financing interest rate."

We study the value of sharing these data in a model with one supplier, N identical retailers, and stationary stochastic consumer demand. There are inventory holding costs and back-order penalty costs. We compare a traditional information policy that does not use shared information with a full information policy that does exploit shared information. In a numerical study we find that supply chain costs are 2.2% lower on average with the full information policy than with the traditional information policy, and the maximum difference is 12.1%. We also develop a simulation-based lower bound over all feasible policies. The cost difference between the traditional information policy and the lower bound is an upper bound on the value of information sharing: In the same study, that difference is 3.4% on average, and no more than 13.8%. We contrast the value of information sharing with two other benefits of information technology, faster and cheaper order processing, which lead to shorter lead times and smaller batch sizes, respectively.

For the settings we study, we conclude that implementing information technology to accelerate and smooth the physical flow of goods through a supply chain is significantly more valuable than using information technology to expand the flow of information."

Moreover, the several private projects and start-ups offering blockchain solutions, which are blossoming in the logistics environment, are threatening the role of the Port of Rotterdam and Portbase as the port inter-organizational information system. Commissioned by Smartport, this research aims to identify the potential blockchain uses on port logistics as well as their relative impact. Therefore, the functionality offered by the current market applications are categorized into four business cases, which identify different uses of the blockchain. These blockchain business cases are subsequently analyzed under six different points of view in order to evaluate the expected benefit that the major stakeholder expect to gain from the technology implementation. Finally, the impact of these business cases is tested on the business model components of the current port information system, Portbase, to identify the disruptive power of the technology. To face the potential issue of disintermediation; a set of solutions have been developed for Portbase on how to adapt its business model in case of a blockchain implementation. This strong conceptualization of the blockchain technology helps the main logistic stakeholders to understand and discuss the potential application of blockchain technology on port logistics, and it provides a much-needed basis for further scientific research. Further development of this conceptualization is needed to structure the ongoing blockchain discussions in both scientific literature and practice."

One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantlyr educed their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios."

Considering the green preference attributes of consumers, the altruistic preference is introduced into the supply chain, and we establish four models: two cooperative manufacturers and one retailer are completely self-interested, one retailer has altruistic preference, two cooperative manufacturers have altruistic preferences, and two cooperative manufacturers and one retailer have altruistic preferences. We address the optimal greenness and pricing decisions of supply chain members, and analyze the impact of altruistic preferences on supply chain decision-making and profits. The results show that the altruistic preference coefficient can significantly affect the decision-making and the profits of supply chain members, and when two manufacturers and one retailer consider altruistic preferences, the altruistic preference coefficients adopted by the three parties are in the certain ranges, the supply chain members’ altruistic preference coefficients can increase the whole supply chain profit. Through analysis, in the three cases where the retailer has altruistic preferences, two manufacturers have altruistic preferences, and two manufacturers and one retailer have altruistic preferences, two manufacturers should adopt higher altruistic preference coefficients, and the retailer should adopt a lower altruistic preference coefficient, and the product greenness under the three altruistic preferences is higher than the product greenness when there is no altruistic preference."

The main idea of RFID is to provide real time monitoring of data by the use of a unique identifier. For a food supply chain to be transparent, every product has to have a proper link to the concerned origin and the status of the products. In order to achieve this blockchain provides a highly secured digital database for each of the food products. In order to prevent cyber-attacks different security analysis was being conducted at different architectural stages"

Modern factories undergo constant transformation, which has impact not only on the organization of manufacturing activities, but also on the functioning of supply chains. The model of contact with the end customer, who frequently moves into the virtual world, is changing, which directly translates to the formation of distribution channels. The occurring changes are referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and we are its eyewitnesses. This paper explores the challenges for modern supply chains that arise as a result of the fourth industrial revolution. It attempts to answer the question to what extent the Industry 4.0 affects the organization of products and information flows in supply chains. Methods: The article makes use of the results of social research, whereas the applied research technique was a survey conducted among 122 supply chains. Moreover, the results of the research performed in 2015 by McKinsey in the form of an interview with 300 experts from production and service companies from USA, Japan and Germany were demonstrated. Additionally, the following 5 case studies were presented: Logistics Knapp AG, Nova Chemicals, BMW, Stratatys and Bosch. Results: One of the research results of the article is a review of the literature on the development of the supply chain concept, as well as on the development of industry, with particular focus on the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The article attempts to determine the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on the functioning of contemporary supply chains. On the basis of social research and case studies, conclusions are drawn about the significance of application of the assumptions of Industry 4.0, as well as about the concerns of companies and entire supply chains regarding the inevitable changes. Finally, a hypothetical supply chain using the assumptions of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is presented on the example of a manufacturer of electric toothbrushes. Conclusions: On the basis of the collected examples and presented research, it can be concluded that the idea of Industry 4.0 is not foreign to contemporary companies and has an influence on the organization of physical and information flows in supply chains. Managers are aware of the changes occurring in the organization of production, procurement and distribution processes in the entire supply chains. However, they are concerned about transferring processes into the virtual world, due to data security issues and capacity of long-distance wireless networks."

In this study, we develop an optimization model for the problem with the objective of makespan minimization. Besides, several structural properties and lower bound formulation are provided to explain the main characteristics of the problem. In this regard, this study also contributes to the existing academic literature by investigating the two-stage supply chain scheduling problem with the additive manufacturing technology. Because the addressed problem belongs to non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard) problem class, a best-fit heuristic-based approach and several selection rules are developed to solve the problem. Each selection rule is designed by considering a distinct structural property of the problem and, thus, each of which is considered to be a different algorithm. A comprehensive experimental study is conducted through random instances, which are generated for small- and large-sized problems by considering real-production data. According to the computational results, the best-fit capacity utilization based selection (BFCUBS) algorithm is superior to others and yields a substantial improvement in the makespan. The reason behind this fact is that the high utilization of capacity enables a large number of jobs to be completed in a short time. Besides, as the number of jobs decreases and the capacity utilization rates increases all algorithms provide better results."

The model assessed biofuel production levels ranging from 1 to 150 PJ a−1 in the context of the existing Swedish forest industry. Biofuel was produced from forestry biomass using hydrothermal liquefaction and hydroprocessing. Simultaneous implementation of all cost reduction strategies yielded minimum biofuel production costs of 18.1–18.2 € GJ−1 at biofuel production levels between 10 and 75 PJ a−1. Limiting the economies of scale was shown to cause the largest cost increase (+0–12%, increasing with biofuel production level), followed by disabling integration benefits (+1–10%, decreasing with biofuel production level) and allowing unimodal truck transport only (+0–6%, increasing with biofuel production level). Distributed supply chain configurations were introduced once biomass supply became increasingly dispersed, but did not provide a significant cost benefit (<1%). Disabling the benefits of integration favors large-scale centralized production, while intermodal transport networks positively affect the benefits of economies of scale. As biofuel production costs still exceeds the price of fossil transport fuels in Sweden after implementation of all cost reduction strategies, policy support and stimulation of further technological learning remains essential to achieve cost parity with fossil fuels for this feedstock/technology combination in this spatiotemporal context."

The objective of this research is to investigate the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ETsystems in agri-food chains. A model that identifies the most significant factors influencing farmers' and processors' behavior regarding the installation and operation of an ETsystem is proposed. The theoretical approach is based on a combination of the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The theoretical concept and related hypotheses are tested by means of PLS-SEM analysis of data from the dairy supply chain in Greece. ‘Perceived Control’ and most importantly, the ‘perceived costs’ over the installation and operation of the ETsystem, is the most important factor with the strongest direct effect influencing the intention to install and operate such a system. This effect is stronger in the case of dairy farmers than in the case of dairy processors. Stronger for dairy farmers is also the identification mechanism thus, their need to comply with their social/business group expectations. Useful findings offered for policy makers and regulators interested in the way traceability systems could be successfully integrated within an agri-food sector to guarantee its added value.

Construction supply chain management (CSCM) requires the tracking of material logistics and construction activities, an integrated platform, and certain coordination mechanisms among CSCM participants. Researchers have suggested the use of building information modeling (BIM) technology to monitor construction activities and manage construction supply chains. However, because material warehousing and deliveries are mostly performed outside construction project sites, project information from a single BIM model is insufficient in meeting the needs of construction supply chain management. In this research, an integrated framework was developed based on four-dimensional (4D) BIM and a geographical information system (GIS) for coordination of construction supply chains between the construction project sites and other project related locations, such as supplier sites and material consolidation centers. The proposed integration was used to solve three common tasks in CSCM, namely (1) supplier selection, (2) determination of number of material deliveries, and (3) allocation of consolidation centers, using information from 4D BIM and GIS. The proposed 4D BIM-GIS framework was demonstrated via case studies. The results of the case studies indicated that determinations of supplier and number of deliveries need to take into account both the transportation distance and material unit price. Mathematical solutions were also generated to support decision making for the allocation of consolidation centers in congested regions with long transportation distances. The outcomes of this paper serve as a decision support base for a more efficient CSCM in the future."

General systems theory and a supply chain management framework serve as theoretical underpinning. Findings Not only primarily manufacturing firms' internal processes and management activities, e.g. in material flow management, are affected by a changeover to AM, but also business processes and management components relating to the supply-and demand-side of a company's supply chain. Research limitations/implications It is proposed that AM's ability to economically build custom products provides the potential to alleviate the common dilemma between product variety and scale economies. Practical implications Manufacturing firms are encouraged to consider the potential effects of AM on supply chain processes and management components when deciding about the adoption of AM technologies in the manufacturing of industrial parts. Original/value The research adds to the widely unexplored effects that AM technology usage in customized parts production has on supply chain business processes and management components. Moreover, the general lack of case studies analyzing implications of AM technology adoption from a supply chain perspective is addressed. The resulting propositions may serve as a starting point for further research on the impact of AM in engineer-to-order supply chains."

Construction supply chain management (CSCM) requires the tracking of material logistics and construction activities, an integrated platform, and certain coordination mechanisms among CSCM participants. Researchers have suggested the use of building information modeling (BIM) technology to monitor construction activities and manage construction supply chains. However, because material warehousing and deliveries are mostly performed outside construction project sites, project information from a single BIM model is insufficient in meeting the needs of construction supply chain management. In this research, an integrated framework was developed based on four-dimensional (4D) BIM and a geographical information system (GIS) for coordination of construction supply chains between the construction project sites and other project related locations, such as supplier sites and material consolidation centers. The proposed integration was used to solve three common tasks in CSCM, namely (1) supplier selection, (2) determination of number of material deliveries, and (3) allocation of consolidation centers, using information from 4D BIM and GIS. The proposed 4D BIM-GIS framework was demonstrated via case studies. The results of the case studies indicated that determinations of supplier and number of deliveries need to take into account both the transportation distance and material unit price. Mathematical solutions were also generated to support decision making for the allocation of consolidation centers in congested regions with long transportation distances. The outcomes of this paper serve as a decision support base for a more efficient CSCM in the future."

This paper attempts to address this gap by studying the supply chains of different food processing organizations in India to assess the role of technological platforms in reducing food wastage in supply chains. Using a qualitative inductive methodology, the author identified the technological platforms that can address food wastage. Then, using multiple case-study analysis, the supply chains of sample firms were evaluated. The author assessed the food loss in these supply chains through comparative analysis to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of selected technological platforms.

As additive manufacturing is inherently less wasteful and only applies raw material where needed, it constitutes a chance to reduce materials usage and related inventories. Even though the technology has faced considerable hype, its adoption still does not match the high expectations. The aim of this study is to overcome limitations of state-of-the-art impact assessments by integrating the potential reduction of materials inventories through the adoption of additive manufacturing in manufacturing and to point out possible implications for supply chain processes. For this purpose, a dynamic evaluation model was developed analysing the adoption of additive manufacturing by integrating the Bass Diffusion Model to provide interesting and novel results for both practitioners and researchers.

However, it seems that the construction industry still hesitates to fully adopt BIM. As some researchers suggest, the root cause may be in the lack of understanding of whether and how BIM improves project outcomes. This research aims to shed some light on this matter by studying the impact of BIM utilization on building project performance. This research follows a model-based approach as opposed to statistically analyzing the project outcomes with and without BIM utilization. The construction project supply chain is modeled at the design and construction activity level to represent the project behavior in terms of cost over time. As traditional project management tools as well as statistical methods are not able to consider the dynamic nature of the projects such as feedbacks, time delays and non-linear relationships, this research uses system dynamics methodology to model the project supply chain. The project supply chain model is calibrated with two sets of the projects; with BIM and without BIM. The two calibrated models, Non-BIM and BIM-utilized, are used to estimate the outcomes of a hypothetical set of the projects. The outcomes are compared in terms of the project performance indexes to analyze the BIM impact on the project performance. Since relatively few projects that utilized BIM were found, this research employs expert elicitation (EE) technique to capture the required knowledge from the industry to estimate the parameters of the BIM-utilized model. The EE is used to build a causal model to capture the impact of BIM utilization on the Non-BIM project model parameters in the absence of sufficient BIM-utilized project data.

However, the recent research is inefficient in computational experiment modeling and lack of a related methodological framework. This paper proposes an agent-based distributed computational experiment framework with in-depth study of material flow, information flow and time flow modeling in supply chain networks. In this framework, a matrix-based formal representation method for material flow, a task-centered representation method for information flow and an agent-based time synchronization mechanism for time flow are proposed to aid building a high quality computational experiment model for a multi-layer supply chain network. In order to conduct the model, a computational experiment architecture for virtual supply chain networks is proposed. In this architecture, coordination mechanisms among agents based on material flow, information flow and time flow as well as consistency check methods for computational experiment models are discussed. Finally, an implementation architecture of the framework is given and a case of virtual supply chain network is developed to illustrate the application of the framework. The computational experiment results of the case show that the proposed framework, not only feasible but correct, has sound advantages in virtual supply chain network development, computational experiment modeling and implementation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Multi-echelon, highly disjointed, and geographically spread are some of the cornerstones of today's supply chain. All these together with different governmental policies and human behavior make it almost impossible to probe incidents and trace events in case of supply chain disruptions. In effect, an end-to-end supply chain, from the most basic raw material to the final product in a customer's possession, is opaque. The inherent cost involved in managing supply chain intermediaries, their reliability, traceability, and transparency further complicate the supply chain. The solution to such complicated problems lies in improving supply chain transparency. This is now possible with the concept of blockchain. The usage of blockchain in a financial transaction is well known. This paper reviews blockchain technology, which is changing the face of supply chain and bringing in transparency and authenticity. This paper first discusses the history and evolution of blockchain from the bitcoin network, and goes on to explore the protocols. The author takes a deep dive into the design of blockchain, exploring its five pillars and three-layered architecture, which enables most of the blockchains today. With the architecture, the author focuses on the applications, use cases, road map, and challenges for blockchain in the supply chain domain as well as the synergy of blockchain with enterprise applications. It analyzes the integration of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of the supply chain domain with blockchain. It also explores the three distinct growth areas: ERP-blockchain supply chain use cases, the middleware for connecting the blockchain with ERP, and blockchain as a service (BaaS). The paper ends with a brief conclusion and a discussion."

Technology resistance is a well-known social science problem that results in reduced performance in business although it has rarely been examined in higher education. A new LMS is mandatory technology that is necessary to use in order to perform well in online global supply chain management courses. The authors drew a sample of graduating supply chain management students to explore this problem because these participants represent the next generation of employees who are likely to work with mandatory technology. The authors argue that it is important to study management students because their technology acceptance motivations will generalize to the future supply chain workforce. If decision makers could understand why management students resist new software, then they could develop strategies to address the critical success factors in hopes that organizational performance might be increased. The design was statistically powerful according to social research standards because the authors examined actual behavior by measuring grade as the dependent variable instead of relying on behavioral intent (BI) which is a subjective perceptional factor because participants are generally asked to self-report this through a survey. In keeping with published empirical literature the authors determined that perceived usefulness predicted BI using multiple regression. In contrary to the existing literature, they did not find that perceived resources (PR) was causally related to actual performance, although they did observe through regression that BI could be forecasted from PR. Their regression model indicated that perceived ease of use (PEOU) was not related to BI but in regression they found PEOU significantly impacted actual performance. These were two contradictory findings that PU impacted BI but not actual performance yet PR and PEOU predicted actual performance but not BI. Another unique departure from the empirical literature was that Computer Self Efficacy (CSE), Perceptions of External Control (PEC), and Computer Anxiety (CANX) were not related to either BI or actual performance. An interesting finding was that perceived enjoyment was strongly related to both BI and actual performance, although the perceptions were opposite between intention versus actual behavior. Multiple regression revealed that lower perceptions of enjoyment was significantly linked to BI while strong perceptions of enjoyment predicted actual performance. Although the authors were certain that peer influence would impact BI and actual performance, in their sample they did not find any support for subjective norm pressure on BI or actual performance. In a similar breakthrough they determined that job relevance and output quality were not causally linked to BI or actual performance. Another statistically significant finding was that positive perceptions of voluntariness were causally related to BI through multiple regression tests and also positively related to actual performance based on hierarchical regression. The authors determined that results demonstrability was causally related to BI from their multiple regression tests but interestingly it was not related to actual performance. The authors extensively discuss the above findings in their conclusions and provide many recommendations for future research. Finally, another valuable contribution the authors made to the scholarly community of practice through this study was to develop large effect-size parsimonious models with very few required factors that captured 56% of the variance on BI and 49% of the variance on actual performance."

The entry of 3PPs into supply chains, not only changes the cash flow, but also decreases consumer price sensitivity and stimulates demand by facilitating credit consumptions. Moreover, information sharing becomes more feasible with the help of 3PPs. To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PP’s profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP. To improve the supply chain profitability, we suggest to provide incentives for retailer information sharing if the 3PP can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of the 3PP users is higher, the grace period of credit consumption is lower, or the cash opportunity cost is lower)."

Comparing the results with and without the big data technology, we find that whether the manufacturer should make more sustainable investment when the retailer adopts the big data technology depends on the service level at the retailer side. Interestingly, it is not always optimal for the retailer to adopt the big data technology. We identify the conditions under which the manufacturer and retailer are better off with the big data technology.

We utilize a model that captures three different environmental regulations: (1) emissions tax, (2) emissions permit-trading, and (3) command-and-control. Our results show that if the variable emissions tax, permit price or emissions penalty is nonzero, the firm should always invest in green technology emissions reductions. In general, we observe an all-or-nothing trend regarding end-of-pipe abatement investment. In particular, the firm invests in best available end-of-pipe abatement technology (BACT-EOP) when the variable emissions tax, permit price or emission penalty is greater than the per unit cost of end-of-pipe abatement. Moreover, we show that investments in end-of-pipe abatement can enhance investments in green technology, but that investments in end-of-pipe abatement should be pursued secondarily. Furthermore, we find that while the facility size, and consequently the local and global transportation emissions, are not impacted by an emissions tax regulation, facility size is impacted by an emissions permit trading or command-and-control emissions regulation. With regards to emissions, frequently there is a direct trade-off between local vs. global transportation and production emissions. To illustrate, we show that regulations that yield the lowest local production emissions, i.e. emissions from a single facility, do not always yield the lowest global production, and local and global transportation emissions. In fact, the conditions that yield the lowest local transportation emissions yield the largest global transportation emissions, and vice versa."

Specifically, we develop a System Dynamics model to capture the blue water footprint, as a key sustainability performance indicator of a poultry supply chain, in the case that relevant environmental and regulatory constraints are applied. The model contributes towards investigating the impact of two potential policy-making scenarios, namely, the ""water penalty"" and the ""water tax"", on the nexus between profitability and water usage across the poultry supply chain. Responding to the regulatory constraints, the food processor either reconfigures the supply chain through rethinking desired inventory levels or implements a water management intervention. The results indicate that investing in water-friendly production technologies could offer a greater advantage to sustainable supply chains in terms of blue water efficiency and profitability, compared to employing inventory management strategies.

After the introduction of online channels, recycling centers and third-party recyclers (TPR) have paid attention to the division of profits in supply chain systems and the behavior of fairness concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to help recycling enterprises make pricing decisions in consideration of fairness concerns. This paper is aimed at answering the following two main questions: (1) When the recycling center or TPR have fairness concerns, how does the optimal pricing and revenue of supply chain members change when both sides are neutral? (2) When the fairness concern coefficient changes, how does the overall revenue of the supply chain system change? How should supply chain members adjust their pricing decisions to maximize their own profits? In order to solve the above problems, Stackelberg game models were made from three aspects: Both sides are neutral, only the TPR has fairness concerns, and only the recycling center has fairness concerns. Based on the results of the example analyses for the model, we found that when only the TPR has fairness concerns, the profit of the recycling center and the transfer price of offline channels will decrease, while the profit of TPR is the opposite. Furthermore, when only a recycling center has fairness concerns, it will lead to the reduction of not only the recycling price and transfer price of offline channels, but also the profits of the entire supply chain system. Specially, whether it is for a recycling center or TPR, a lower level of fairness concern coefficient has a stronger impact on pricing and revenue than at high levels."

Research has identified that fragmentation and inefficiency still existed in the water industry project delivery processes. These issues can be addressed by harnessing the collaboration that BIM brings by using emerging information technology. The UK water industry has had little research in the use of BIM in the project delivery processes over the years. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the research is to explore and examine BIM elements currently used in the water industry, as well as understand the organisational cultural support for BIM. It also investigated the adoption of BIM which will enable to improve water industry project delivery processes. An empirical study was performed in the UK given the relatively new and unexplored nature of the research problem, a qualitative research methodology was adopted. In total, 14 semi-structured interviews from six water sector organisations were conducted to collect data, which was then analysed using thematic analysis for inference and conclusion. Findings: The study identified that BIM has already changed how projects are delivered by the water companies and their supply chain. Use of emerging technology such as Autodesk Revit, Civil 3D and virtual reality has gained traction and is leading organisations to continue investing in these areas to remain relevant. Although staff training was offered by all organisations within the study cohort, some interviews still thought that more can be done by their organisations as BIM is still maturing. Those interviewed regarded BIM models as data and information rich with the ability to enable the supply chain to obtain quicker approvals. Originality/value: The paper provides a richer insight into the understanding and awareness of BIM elements used in the water industry to improve project delivery processes. This study suggests that the water industry supply chain has taken positive steps and started to benefit from BIM use. It also recommends that there is a need for cross-sector collaboration to capture and share best and worst practices relating to BIM adoption in the water sector."

To handle different types of uncertainty, including randomness, epistemic and deep uncertainties, a hybrid robust optimization model is proposed. Uncertainty in technology is presented as imprecise conversion rates, which are expressed as probabilistic scenarios. Biomass yield is treated as fuzzy numbers while demand is assumed to vary in a known interval. Furthermore, fixed costs of the biorefineries are calculated according to the piecewise linear functions in which segments are capacity level intervals.

This study is based on the results of literature review, experts’ opinion acquisition, and qualitative system dynamics modeling. So, according to method, triangular researches have been considered. The purpose of this research is to explore pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) challenges and the dynamics behavior of variables playing a special role in PSC. Also, it provides different policies to overcome the challenges. For the first step to reach this goal, several semi-structured interviews with expert supply chain managers are conducted to explore the main challenges. Inaccuracy in forecasting, long lead times, lack of optimum target inventory, and high SC costs are the most important PSC problems. Then, qualitative system dynamics methodology is used to demonstrate the inter-relationship between variables that have impact on challenges. Finally, three strategic policies are recommended including: Collaborative relationship with suppliers, Investment in new technologies, and Information technology (IT) establishment. Consequently, the results can give PSC managers a comprehensive view for decision making and bringing their attention to the importance of feedback behavior of variables in long term and their effects on organizational decisions and goals."

Therefore, coordination and collaboration among all links of a construction supply chain are essential for success of construction projects. But, construction supply chain integration requires a cost-effective information and communication platform that links multiple companies. The Internet and Web technology have emerged as the most cost-effective means for driving supply chain integration. E-business on the Internet is based on cutting edge software frameworks– a generic open, end-to-end infrastructure of interoperable software solutions that provide functions enabling business communicate efficiently over the Internet. These technologies will all have an increasingly profound influence on the company's business and supply chain processes because they reinforce competitiveness in the construction markets.

The level will obviously be constrained by the relationship between product manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components, product distributors, etc. More and more enterprises are beginning to effectively carry out internal management changes, and the traditional competitive relationship among enterprises gradually transforming into a new type of partnership. The supply chain plays an increasingly important role in the process of enterprise competition. High-level supply chain operation and management are the key to successful operation of the company. The supply chain is a complex system, which requires members to reduce the “bullwhip effect” through information sharing, to achieve decision synchronization, reduce inventory, and improve market response. Therefore, information sharing is an important part of supply chain research. The competition in the century is the competition between supply chains. The end-customer’s individualization of products, the increasing requirements for diversification, and the increasing uncertainty of the economic environment have prompted enterprises to pay more and more attention to the coordination of relations among members of the supply chain. The key to coordinate the supply chain is to realize information sharing. This paper proposes an architecture of agile supply chain management system based on the multi-agent information sharing under the guidance of self-organization theory. At the same time, the prototype of the supply chain management system was established by using web technology, distributed object technology (CORBA/DCOM) and related information resource organization and management technology."

A sample of 54 rural farms in the dairy supply chain of the western region of Santa Catarina, Brazil, was used to test four hypotheses about what can drive sustainability. Furthermore, first- and second-order structural equation models using SMART PLS software were used for the analysis of the data. The results obtained show that social sustainability is positively influenced by the use of good management practices, and the latter, as well as public policies, positively influence economic sustainability. Furthermore, it was found that improvements in production techniques positively influence environmental sustainability, and this is mostly influenced by the use of good management practices, and less so by policies directed at the supply chain.

Many countries established strict rules to ensure the food traceability ""from farm to fork"" to meet the demand of consumer safety and to ensure public health. Consequently, the concepts of controlled supply chain, brand of quality and traceability of food products have had a strong evolution. Companies in the food production sector must evolve and change their organizational and management chain to satisfy increasingly stringent government rules and to respond to the requirements of the market. From this point of view, NFC (Near Field Communication) has all the requirements to become the main technology for traceability in the various food sectors. This paper proposes a solution to gather information throughout the entire food supply chain and bring it directly to the consumer. The architecture consists of a complex identification system based on NFC tags, which cumulates data during all phases of the production process. The aim of this work is to keep track of the information generated during food processing, not only for traceability purposes, but also for enhancing and optimizing production. The data generated by the traceability system are collected in a cloud database through apps on Android smartphones. The information is accessible by the consumers through a public Android application. The pork supply chain has been used as an application example of the proposed methodology."

In order to support this objective, this paper integrates building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information systems (GIS) into a unique system, which enables keeping track of the supply chain status and provides warning signals to ensure the delivery of materials. First, the proposed methodology is implemented by using BIM due to its capability to accurately provide a detailed takeoff in an early phase of the procurement process. Furthermore, in order to support the wide range of spatial analysis used in the logistics perspective (warehousing and transportation) of the CSCM, GIS is used in the present model.

In addition to the cost of sustainable practices themselves, record keeping required to keep track of those practices and auditing by certifying agencies are costly for the supplier. To make matters worse, information problems among supply chain partners-moral hazard, adverse selection, and holdup hinder both investments in technology and efforts toward green certification. We investigate whether the pairing of a new technology like blockchain with an access-based business model, where users of a technology pay for access rather than make large up-front investments, can alleviate these three information problems. Academic/Practical Relevance: Moral hazard, adverse selection, and holdup are pervasive information problems in supply chains. We examine whether and how the recent phenomenon of companies setting up per-missioned blockchains can help address all three information problems concurrently for green supply chains. Methodology: We build a game theoretic model of the interaction between the buyer and the supplier. We extend existing models by explicitly modeling the supplier's operational decisions in an open market as the supplier's outside option rather than assume fixed outside option values. Results: The implementation of blockchain technology allows the buyer to share more of its green premium with the supplier-lowering moral hazard. By appropriately pricing access, the buyer can induce a separating equilibrium and address the adverse selection problem. By placing the burden of investment in technology with the buyer, an access-based business model also eliminates the holdup problem. Managerial Implications: Our results show that blockchain technology-on its own-cannot alleviate all of the information problems faced by a green supply chain. Large buyers need to pair blockchain technology with an access-based business model to unleash its full potential."

As supply chains (SCs) expand, complexity also increases, as does the associated demand for well-skilled SC professionals. To achieve the expected SCM skills in organisations, a skills framework is likely to guide managers and practitioners. Unfortunately, research on SCM skills frameworks is fragmented, providing little or no guidance to practitioners. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to document the SC skills described in the literature, identify existing frameworks and propose a framework to guide practitioners and academics. Method: A systematic literature review design was followed. The data obtained were analysed using content analysis. Results: About 270 SCM skills were identified. The skills were grouped using many SC skills frameworks, including business logistics management, T-shaped, expertise level, SCM skills and hard and soft skills. The proposed skills framework included skills related to business, logistics, management, and ethics and environment. Emerging skills such as the application of blockchain technology, big data and SC sustainability have been included in the framework. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a guide to SC managers about which skills groups to focus on and advises a contingency-based approach to identify the relevant skills per group in line with organisational requirements."

This embedded manufacturers to construct the global supply chain comprising suppliers, factories and recyclers to assemble products at a lower cost. On the other hand, global warming has become a serious environmental issue, and CO2 emissions on the global supply chain should be visualized and reduced by life cycle assessment. However, CO2 emissions vary for each country because of disparities in the energy mix. Therefore, manufacturers need to select appropriate suppliers for specific components, especially to ensure a lower procurement cost of parts and material-based GHG (GreenHouse Gas) emissions. Additionally, the economic model in the world shifts to circular economy which includes recycling the products economically because of the regenerative use for materials. If the parts inside the end-of-life (EOL) products are recycled, CO2 emissions in the procurement stage can be recovered with recycling cost. Therefore, recyclers need a disassembly part selection that selects recycling or disposal for each part in order to recover CO2 emission and reduce recycling cost in the EOL stage. Thus, certain product data, such as GreenHouse Gas (GHG) emissions and costs, needs to be shared with not only suppliers/factories but also recyclers by IoT technology on the global supply chain for connecting supplier and disassembly part selections. This study proposes a decision support model for economical carbon recovery by connecting supplier and disassembly part selections on procurement and EOL stages. First, a bill of materials (BOM) is prepared using an Asian supplier selection with the 3D-CAD model and Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database. Second, disassembled parts of the EOL assembly products from the BOM data are selected for either recycling or disposal using 0-1 integer programming with ε constraint method. Finally, the results of the disassembly part selection, in terms of CO2 emission reduction and costs are discussed."

However, such collaborations arguably have the highest failure record of the various supply chain management practices that are currently being applied. Part of the problem has been the uncertain external environment, an overreliance on technology, and lack of trust among partners. Based on Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) and Relational Exchange Theory (RET), it is clear that environment, asset specificity, and trust are key determinants for the success of collaborations among firms. However, the fuzziness of the interdependency among these determinants and their influences on supply chain collaborative processes still remains unknown. This study thus focuses on Taiwanese manufacturing firms as an example case, and empirically probes the relationships among these dimensions and their effects on these processes. To accommodate the vagueness of human opinions, the fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique is applied to examine this issue, and to produce a causal relations map. This study also provides a discussion and insights for supply chain practitioners."

Organisations have begun to recognise the importance of their supply chain and the necessity for qualified supply chain managers. Therefore, there is a need for further research on the impact of these capabilities on individual and firm performance. Sustained performance of a firm depends on dynamic capabilities and it allows firms to align and adapt strategies according to the volatile external environment. Using dynamic capabilities theory, the supply chain manager capabilities model was developed as a way for supply chain managers to effectively use their skills and past experiences to improve their own and firm's performance. Primary data was collected through a survey distributed to supply chain management professionals. The results strongly support the relationship between technology and soft skills with supply chain manager capabilities. Interestingly, our study identifies sequential relationship amongst the three constructs such as capabilities, individual and firm performance. Capabilities are related with individual performance whereas individual performance is related with the firm performance. However, our findings revealed that there is no direct relationship between supply chain manager capabilities and firm performance."

This is one of the first studies of blockchain adoption in the Greek shipping industry, which has not so far been examined by the literature, in direct comparison to early adopters in other European countries such as Norway. The research examined eight Greek shipping companies using workshops with experienced supply chain personnel. Qualitative analysis identified the current position of these organisations in terms of blockchain adoption, by considering possible benefits and inhibitors to implementation. Despite benefits of automated processes and reduced paperwork as a result of smart contracts, findings show a reluctance to adopt BCT. That is, enterprise resource planning (ERP) transformations have left organisations fatigued and disinclined towards further systems development and resistant to subsequent change. Also, the exposure of shared information in the shipping nexus is considered to cause a threat to competitive survival."

Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible."

This study shows that product recall events are increasing in general but recall events associated with ADAS/AV technology form an increasingly large percentage of these recall events. Based on this analysis, we describe ADAS/AV-specific aspects of risk mitigation and present a multidimensional approach, combining production-centric risk mitigation avenues in the automotive supply chain with the transfer of residual financial risks via insurance. We find that this comprehensive risk mitigation approach benefits in higher transparency of total production costs and increased resilience of the automotive supply chain. Against the background of an increasing product recall risk resulting from the increasing automation and interconnectedness of modern vehicles, we therefore suggest a closer, more strategic cooperation between insurance companies, car manufacturers and automotive suppliers for the benefit of all parties."

This study aims to assess the supply chain skills needs within the context of a UK-based higher education institution involving graduates, academics and employers to appreciate the graduate skills demands of modern supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methods study entailing in-depth interviews with academics followed by a questionnaire distributed to graduates and employers has been designed and utilised. Findings: The findings indicate that the changing supply chain scope encourages the requisition and development of different supply chain skills with varied levels of emphases in relation to 25 skills identified in the literature. Key graduate skills needs are highlighted, including time management, collaborative learning, teamwork and problem solving, with the addition of two supply chain skill areas, namely specialist training and the understanding and application of regulations. The findings of the current study present a limited emphasis on information technology (IT) skills, despite the significant IT advancements and changes in supply chains. Research limitations/implications: The study has been carried out in a UK university delivering undergraduate supply chain management courses. It would be beneficial to test whether the findings are exemplary across other supply chain courses and to investigate the integration of these skills within the supply chain syllabus and how employers, graduates and academic parties could actively engage in developing the agenda for future supply chain skills needs. Practical implications: This research paper highlights the gaps in supply chain skills, which inevitably puts considerable pressure on operatives and managers whose responsibility it is to ensure compliance with regulations and professional bodies. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the supply chain skills discussion and reports subject relevant challenges for supply chain educators by engaging three key stakeholders – graduate employers, graduates and academics.

These implementations have delivered benefits in terms of data synchronization and information flows within the organization, and with trading partners providing valuable inputs for planning and optimization of schedules and reporting. The best and the most important technology of these technologies is RFID or Radio Frequency Identification systems. RFID is one of the most promising and the most advanced technologies released in recent years. Perishable and short life products, especially foodstuffs, are those cases causing the largest problems and challenges for supply chain management. These challenges are mainly due to the variety in the number of products, special needs for tracing and tracking the product flow during the supply chain, the short life of the products, the requirement for controlling the temperature in the supply chain and the high volume of the products we deal with.  Using the RFID system is one of the best potential solutions helping the supply chain management solve logistic problems of spoilable products. In food industries, the period of the product storage is short due to the high probability that the product spoils and the short time of the storage of the final product. Today, the changes in the ways of producing, distributing, maintaining and selling foodstuffs have caused changes in consumers' demands to increase the quality and the durability of foodstuff packages. Innovations are created in this industry to make sure of the desirable performance of packing in the supply chain of the foodstuffs, such as active or intelligent packing methods.

As a result, a framework including all of the effects (consolidated and inconclusive) found of AM adoption on a company's business was developed. While various effects (e.g., the feasibility of a complex product, the freedom of product design, mass customization capability, and product variety) have frequently been studied in the literature and are consolidated, some are still considered consolidated effects but presenting only conceptual studies (e.g., enterprise reliability, equipment reliability/availability for maintenance, information flow, and production democratization) then needed practical research.

The data arising from the connectivity of physical assets is the foundation of the Internet of Things (IoT). But converting this raw IoT data into an opportunity for process improvement brings challenges in dealing with nonstandard data in unprecedented volumes. To address these challenges, a new generation of IoT-enabled analytic applications for supply chain planning and execution is now becoming available. Supply chain professionals have grappled with the challenges associated with a lack of complete visibility across the supply chain for decades. Fortunately, forward-thinking innovative companies have developed purpose-built supply chain visibility solutions, leveraging IoT technology, to finally achieve the requisite layer of visibility into the supply chain. For the first time in history, complex global supply chains have the capability to connect with their products and processes to achieve new levels of supply chain visibility. IDC OPINION As ubiquitous connectivity becomes the norm across the global business landscape and the Internet of Things continues to gain acceptance, the explosion of data created out of such a connected world is driving firms to develop and implement IoT strategies with purpose-built analytic applications to capitalize on this wealth of information. The lag between data collection and action has been dramatically reduced because of the increased sophistication of sensor technology, advanced mobile communications, and purpose-built analytic applications. The reduction in the time between data capture and decision making enables firms to react to changes in operations in real time, presenting the opportunity for dramatically improved operations to those who leverage this advanced technology. The Internet of Things is driving supply chains to rethink and retool in order to inject a layer of agility and responsiveness never before seen into an ever-changing environment. Massive real-time data captured by sensors represents the raw material for this transformation of operations. But it is the delivery of purpose-built analytic applications that turns this raw material into actionable insight."

In particular, the typical retailer-supplier flexible commitment (RSFC) problem is considered to cope with the uncertain environment. After modeling, robust optimization (RO) and the affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) methodology are applied to solve the model. Finally, this paper uses a numerical example for the analysis of how RFID technology can be exploited in supply chain, and the effect of demand uncertainty on the systems. The results highlight the importance of inventory availability related rates and variable uncertainty in determining the profitability of RFID adoption, which can provide managerial guidelines to supply chain firms."

The objectives of this article are to examine lessons learned from HIV supply chain initiatives, describe opportunities to advance supply chain systems for NCD health commodities based on HIV supply chain successes and identify areas where additional research is still needed for reliable NCD supply chains in LMICs. Design: We describe practical experiences gained from developing HIV supply chain systems and how those lessons can be used to inform NCD supply chain systems. Methods: Supply chain challenges with HIV commodities in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are identified and categorized using literature review and expert experiences. Solutions are described on the basis of lessons learned from global HIV initiatives. Opportunities to further advance NCD supply chain systems are recommended. Results: Supply chain challenges can be organized into two groups: 1) resource mobilization and 2) resource utilization. Global HIV initiatives have responded to resource mobilization challenges by increasing availability of funding, filling human resource gaps, improving essential storage and creating better transport mechanisms and information technology infrastructure. These initiatives have assisted in better resource utilization by strengthening procurement processes, standardizing and simplifying supply chain systems, reducing integrity and security vulnerabilities and harnessing the power of better data. Advances achieved through HIV initiatives are readily transferrable to NCD supply chains with minimal additional investment. Research opportunities exist to identify the most efficient and cost-effective ways to develop more reliable supply chains for NCDs."

Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides a structured literature review of the state-of-the-art in technology adoption by LSPs. Drawing on the innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and absorptive capacity, the explorative case study research includes systematic analyses of ten technology projects conducted by seven different LSPs. Findings: The findings illustrate that the technology access modes (make, buy and ally) prejudge the success of the integration process in terms of technology acceptance, as well as process quality, speed and costs of integration. This relationship is moderated by technology-, firm-, environment- and relation-related factors. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited by its qualitative research approach, only seven different LSPs were addressed. Furthermore, the scope of the investigated technologies is broad but not exhaustive. Practical implications: For practitioners, research indicates that the way LSPs access technologies is highly related to a successful integration process. Therefore, the paper provides practical support for improving technology adoption. Originality/value: As the link between LSPs’ technology access strategies and a successful integration process has been largely neglected thus far, this paper is the first contribution addressing this research gap.

Based on three company case studies in the information technology and electronic industries in China, we identify and demonstrate how a blended business and environmental value can be created from adopting a sustainable supply chain management approach. The adoption of a sustainable supply chain management approach is rapidly becoming a key business challenge and opportunity in China and other large emerging economies around the world, where our greatest environmental management challenges currently reside and will continue to exist for many years to come. The value creation framework proposed in research focuses on evaluating three case study companies who appear in various stages of an electronic industry supply chain. Value creation within a supply chain can provide the impetus for organizations to adopt circular economy, sustainable supply chain practices, for competitive reasons. In addition, we describe how a value proposition can be evaluated at two levels of analysis, a more specific micro-level and a more general meso-level of analysis. The four major business value dimensions include cost reduction, revenue generation, resiliency, and legitimacy and image.

Design/methodology/approach: This study employed an inductive approach in examining the dynamics of the pharmaceutical supply chain. The study also used analytical hierarchical process in identifying factors that are detrimental to the ACT supply chain. Findings: The study revealed that there are basically two main supply channels through which ACT enters the Ghanaian pharmaceutical system - private and public. The ACT network depicts a strong evidence of actor interdependence and long-term relationships. However, the key supply chain enabler - the use of information technology - was found to be lacking, leading to delays and disruptions in the supply chain system. Disruption was found to be the main detrimental factor to the supply chain although delay was found to be occurring more frequently. Price increases indicated a low effect on the supply network at the pharmacy level, but the general price of the highly subsidised effective ACT (Coartem) remains very high. Research limitations/implications: Owing to constraints in accessibility, it was challenging to contact all the actors in the network individually, especially the consumer. Drugs considered in the study were the WHO approved ACT, even though efforts were made to compile available anti-malarial drugs on the market.

The development in the electronics sector is geared towards growing miniaturization, more complex and compact products, all of which stand in the way of economical and ecological recycling. These factors in addition to the inherent complexity of reverse supply chains (RSC) due to the uncertainties associated with the quantity, quality, and timing of returns make returns management all the more complicated. Information technology and telecommunication equipment industries have started to realize that RSC can be used to gain competitive advantage. Effective performance management is an important aspect of the RSC initiative, and is the key to recognizing the benefits of efficient supply chain management systems.This research spotlights on this particular problem from a information technology and telecommunication equipment industries perspective, as it poses the greatest challenges in handling returns due to the presence of high clock speed products and greater return volume and variability. In this research, Performance Evaluation Analytic for Reverse Logistics Methodology is developed to facilitate decision making from the perspective of an enterprise engaged in reverse logistics. It explores the various reverse logistics functions and product lifecycle stages. It also develops some key business strategies and performance metrics that can be employed to be successful in returns handling. Deployment of this methodology in their organizations not only provides them with a real world assessment of what strategies, reverse logistics functions, product lifecycle stages, or key performance indicators impact the Reverse Logistics Performance Value, thereby allowing them to continuously improve their returns management capabilities but also helps us to compare the efficiencies of the two organisation under study.

Biomass technology is limited by the complex biomass element characteristic and properties, and as well as high transportation cost. Unique property of biomass creates a gap in selection of biomass feedstock for each technology. Most of the technology developments are based on particular biomass species. This creates problems to implement the same technology in area without respective biomass, thus require more work to be done on specific biomass species available in that system. A novel technique - Biomass Element Life Cycle Analysis (BELCA) is introduced to tackle these problems. BELCA acts as a platform to study the element characteristic of each biomass from plantation site and biomass generated from process plant. This study allows better understanding of respective biomass characteristic for higher level of biomass utilisation and applications. The new approach integrates biomass resources with process feedstock via biomass element characteristic and optimised supply chain network for optimum biomass utilisation and application. Biomass characteristic is presented in a simple graphical approach to enhance the understanding and highlight their potential value. Combination of this method with biomass characteristic data bank will make the biomass selection easier. Biomass characteristic study enable integration of underutilised biomass into existing system, hence biomass industry can be improved. A biomass supply chain case study incorporated with BELCA approach is conducted. The result shows significant improvement of BELCA supply chain model over the existing system."

In this paper, we focus on the underlying factors for the solar panel manufacturing cost decrease from supply chain improvements, which have led to a more attractive profitability potential in the industry despite price pressure on revenue. However, we find no evidence that the supply chain cost gains can continue to dramatically lower the cost of production any further. Therefore, manufacturers need to find new ways to improve the manufacturing efficiencies subject to the theoretical limits on energy conversion efficiencies or move up the technology maturity curve to the next generation of solar technology."

Two main theoretical perspectives emerge from the literature. The first predicts a logical progressive implementation of technology over time. The second views situational factors as moderating progressive implementation over time. The authors propose a third, calculative IT implementation model and empirically assess the validity of these diverging models. Design/methodology/approach – The authors took a qualitative, theory-testing approach. Cross-sectional surveys conducted in 2001 and 2011 – yielding responses from 62 matching firms – showed dynamic IT implementation patterns over time and allowed the selection of nine case studies for comparison. Findings – Results provide substantial support for a calculative model alongside the situational and progressive perspectives. This model addresses three problematic assumptions that underpin the progressive and situational perspectives: that IT implementation will follow logical stages; that implementation of these technologies represents a rational choice; and that managers implement these technologies to improve the performance of entire supply chains. Research limitations/implications – The empirical investigations were limited to Australian manufacturers. Further studies should extend the generalisability of the findings and study the phenomenon in different contexts. Practical implications – The study enhances practitioners’ understanding of the difficulties and complexities of IT implementation decisions among supply chain partners. Such an understanding may motivate managers to pursue IT adoption that goes beyond addressing locally focused performance metrics. Originality/value – The findings make a significant theoretical and practical contribution and provide the basis for isolating and operationalising the calculative model for further empirical testing."

In this research, a hybrid system dynamics-mathematical programming approach is developed to design and plan a biodiesel supply chain from biomass fields to consumption markets. The supply chain faces limitations in biodiesel production. Water resource limitations for biodiesel production, land limitations for biomass procurement, and technological issues are the most important limitations considered in the system dynamics model. In addition, competition between fossil fuels and biodiesel is taken into account. The proposed methodology, firstly, estimates the most important parameters in biodiesel supply chain in a given planning horizon. Then, estimated parameters are used as inputs of the mathematical model and the optimal supply chain decisions are made by means of a stochastic mixed-integer programming model. Besides, a scenario-based approach is used to model the disruption risks for links and biomass fields. Finally, a numerical experiment is presented to show the applicability of the methodology according to some interviews with experts in Iran. Results demonstrate the potential appropriate market of biodiesel in Iran while several resource and technology limitations and environmental pollution avoid growth of biodiesel market. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed on risk preferences of decision makers and government policies adopted to improve the biodiesel market."

This study investigates the possible alignment between them in terms of the synergistic effect on corporate sustainability. Based on the task-technology fit model, GSCM and GIS can be viewed as the task- and technology-side endeavors. The extant conceptualization of the fit between a task and a technology assumes their interdependence, but efficiency-oriented GSCM and technology-driven GIS are relatively independent from each other as they can be carried out separately. Formed on the basis of spontaneous employee participation in both, their alignment is rather informal than formal. Unlike the regular task-technology fit from a top-down arrangement, such a bottom-up alignment is not the necessary condition for GSCM and GIS to take effects, but adds to their direct impacts on green innovation outcome in a one-plus-one-greater-than-two manner. Survey observations gathered from over 300 organizations in China confirm that the informal alignment between GSCM and GIS enhances economic, operational, environmental and social performances on top of their primary contributions. The findings regarding the synergy between GSCM and GIS on corporate sustainability provide researchers and practitioners helpful insights on how to optimize green innovation effectiveness."

Telemedicine which is used interchangeably with the term telehealth is the remote delivery of healthcare to patients through information and communication technology, including communication between two or more health professionals who are not in the same location. Thus, it needs secure transmission of medical data through text, sound, image, or video. This system can be a tele-education, tele-monitoring, tele-consultation, or tele-intervention. Telemedicine has several benefits, both for health professionals and medical institution as well as for the patients, especially for the development of healthcare delivery in remote area and also to make interaction between healthcare professional faster. However, telemedicine still has lack of regulation in Indonesia. There is still no regulation about license for the health professional and safety of medical data. Ethical problems in telemedicine are also still an issue, especially about patient's confidentiality, and also it can weaken doctor-patients relationship.

When acquisition objectives and their concomitant requirements are not rigorously defined and managed, the cyber-based products and services can pose operational risks to end user organizations and possibly to society if security, reliability and/or safety are compromised, especially in critical infrastructure sectors. However, there is some disagreement about the fundamental objectives of cyber supply chain risk management. Objectives such as trustworthiness, integrity, security and reliability are often noted as key, while safety and other objectives are often omitted. Divergent guidance further compounds the difficulties encountered by an acquiring organization in writing meaningful requirements or policies for managing supply chain risk - whether from products and services, or to the operation of the supply chain, or to sensitive supply chain information. This paper recommends a set of objectives for cyber supply chain risk management and examines the connotations of each objective with the intent to improve risk coverage. It then examines the tradeoffs among the various objectives that acquirers and suppliers make and the trust assumptions that can result in risk exposure. Awareness of the tradeoffs and the degree to which organizations value one objective over another helps clarify their risk tolerance or risk appetite and enables them to apply appropriate management controls."

Accordingly, remanufacturing systems have been developed to recover or perform proper disposal of WEEE. Over the decades, remanufacturing has continuously grown and has attracted customers' interest in reprocessed products, hence, inducing the competition of the said market. For a remanufacturer to gain a competitive advantage in the market, it is necessary to optimize both operational and managerial aspects comprehensively. Therefore, this study aims to model the competition between independent remanufacturer player's (IR) supply chain systems that integrate these two aspects. First, IR's supply chain system operational decisions involving multi-period-horizon and multi-process production planning, product flow, and product purchasing and takeback will be formulated into a mixed integer linear model. Lastly, IRs' supply chain system compete with each other in a perfect-market-competition game model that considers technology licensing and product quality strategies. Results from numerical examples show that royalty licensing is the better technology licensing strategy compared to fixed-fee licensing strategy in terms of costs. In addition, selling remanufactured products, which are of higher quality, yield less profit than selling refurbished products. However, remanufactured products are less susceptible to product value depreciation and price changes over time, therefore, generating more stable income in different conditions. With the fast-paced technological development, the proposed model could address complex remanufacturing supply chain problems, offering decision-makers a tool in optimizing the remanufacturing system."

Despite an abundance of forest area alongside the promotion of biomass in energy policies, however, woody biomass utilization still remains low in Japan. The woody biomass supply chain, considered as a socio-technical system, involves a complex, cross-sectoral stakeholder network in which inter-organizational dynamics necessitates well-organized management based on an understanding of formal factors such as technology, as well as informal factors such as social relations and culture. In this paper, success factor perceptions from across the woody biomass supply chain are investigated based on semi-structured interviews with four stakeholders in the Kyushu region of Japan. Identified success factors here are: 1) respect of values & traditions, 2) transportation infrastructure, 3) business model integration, 4) relationship & trust, 5) local vitalization and 6) biomass quality control. A convergence as well as divergence of perceptions are observed, involving both formal and informal dimensions. Aiming to balance perceptions and to enable long-term success of woody biomass in Japan, a series of policy implications are drawn, including cross-ministerial integration, knowledge building on wood logistics, forest certification, local coordinators, biomass quality control standards and a feed-in-tariff for heat. This paper suggests a new arena of policy-making based on the importance of considering both informal and formal dimensions in energy policy."

To achieve this objective organizations as part of the supply chains adopt different technologies. Adopting technologies is an expensive venture, especially its maintenance. A major chunk of IT investments goes into maintenance of current IT. Cloud computing technology emerges as a saviour to organizations of all sizes in any supply chain as it allows organizations to use required IT without actually owning it. The purpose of this project is to determine the factors affecting adoption of cloud computing technology by organizations of the Saudi petrochemical supply chains. However, there is no technology adoption model that may be applied to organizations as part of supply chains within the context of Saudi Arabia. Hence, a new technology adoption model “Technology-Supply Chain- Environment” (TSE) is developed that not only takes the technological, supply chain, and environmental variables into consideration but also considers the moderating impact of cultural and other variables on the adoption of cloud computing technology. A sequential explanatory mixed methodology was employed to achieve the objective of this study. In quantitative phase, data were collected through a self-administered online questionnaire based survey that generated 303 valid responses from mid-to-senior level decision-making supply chain practitioners from a range of organisations belonging to Saudi petrochemical supply chain. The derived research questions were tested using various data analysis techniques including principal component analysis and structural equation modelling. During the qualitative phase, 48 semi-structured interviews were conducted to have deeper understanding of the results from the earlier phase. Further to the semi-structured interviews, a focus group discussion session with nine experts from industry and academics was also conducted to understand the impact of cultural variables on the adoption of cloud technology in the same context. The relationships of independent and dependent variables were simultaneously tested on both behavioural intention and direct adoption. The results indicated that some variables were strongly related to intention to adopt while some others were strongly related to direct adoption. Security concerns, facilitating conditions, trading partner power, and complexity significantly and positively affected intentions to adopt cloud technology. Relative advantage, compatibility, and behavioural intentions significantly and positively affected adoption of cloud technology. Top management support and trading partner readiness were not found significant predictors of either behavioural intention or direct adoption of cloud technology. Trading partner power was the most significant factor for the intention to adopt and also to direct adoption of cloud technology. The proposed model explained 67% of the variance in the intentions and 57% in the direct adoption of cloud technology. This research focused only one industry, Saudi petrochemical industry. Further research would be required to apply similar models on different industries. The findings reveal the important role of cloud computing service providers to enable end-users to better evaluate the use of cloud computing. It also reveals that top management support is no longer a driver as organisations are starting to adopt cloud computing services on the basis of flexible and more agile IT resources in order to support business growth and hence the whole supply chain. The TSE model is the first of its kind in which supply chain variables are integrated and it is hoped that this model will open up the way for future research in constructing new models for technology adoption within supply chains."

Military products in the world have a high level of diversity, delivery speed and appropriative operational functionality. Therefore, various producing, high quality and high-speed delivery of military products are of great importance in enhancing Iran’s defensive power. Defense industries’ supply chain agility is a response to how to produce military products with these features. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a model for the agile supply chain of defense industries to show the relationship between agile practices and their hierarchy. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors identify the most important supply chain agility practices by expert’s questionnaire. Then, using factor analysis, practices are categorized and validated based on structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM showed a meaningful relationship between agile supply chain practices. Finally, using interpretative structural modeling, a model is presented to show the logical relationships and hierarchy between these practices. Findings: The results show that out of a total of 62 practices introduced in the previous research for the agile supply chain, 37 practices in the agility of the supply chain of defense industries are effective. The 4 new agility practices were identified in this research. These 41 practices were classified into 8 categories including supplier relationship, workshop level management, organizational structure improvement, human resource management, product designing, improve and integrate the process, application of information technology and customer relationship. Improvement of organizational structure was at the highest level of the model. Therefore, managers first should focus on it. Research limitations/implications: Given the confidentiality of information in the defense industry, the distribution of questionnaires and their collection was one of the most important limitations. A variety of defense products in land, air and sea areas, and a large number of industries in each sector, forced the authors to select the only land area. Although the results of this research can be used in the air and sea areas, but cannot be said that the implementation of this study presented model will fully lead to the defense industries’ supply chain agility in air and sea sectors. Originality/value: This is the first research on the supply chain agility of Iran’s defense industry that bridges the gap between theory and practice. The classification of 41 practices in the form of 8 measures and examining the relationship between them is a new and practical approach for understanding the relationships between different variables that affect supply chain agility. This study introduces four new agility practices including the use of new technology and equipment, human resource balance, the use of expert human resources, training and employee empowerment, which can be considered in many industries of developing or less developed countries. Considering the specific situation of defense industry supply chain in comparison with other industries, the results of this research can be used by other defense industries of similar countries."

From a business perspective, each organisation is usually concerned with its own profit margins and processes. In our global market, however, organisations now realise that they can no longer compete successfully on the basis of their internal operational efficiencies alone. They are therefore constantly aware of the need to improve not only their internal processes but also their alignment with other supply chain linkages in an effort to optimise the performance of the whole supply chain. Such alignment, in the conveyancing environment, includes government departments that are generally less willing to adopt business principles, which in turn makes optimisation of the whole supply chain more difficult.Objectives: The article describes a supply chain perspective of the conveyancing processes in South Africa and reports some of the factors that influence and delay conveyancing transactions. It explores possibilities of collaborative relationships between different role players in the conveyancing supply chain. It aims to show that a supply chain approach, as opposed to a singular organisational approach, can help to reduce process bottlenecks and delays in order to improve overall process efficiency.Method: The research, on which the findings are based, was exploratory in nature and followed a mixed-methods (quantitative or qualitative) approach and included both structured questionnaires and personal interviews.Results: The results of the study revealed that many different types of delays occur at various entities across the whole supply chain involved in property transfers. These delays are presented in a table and diagram.Conclusion: It is recommended that greater adoption of electronic technology across the whole supply chain would improve overall efficiency, eliminate bottlenecks and contribute towards efforts to optimise the conveyancing supply chain in South Africa. In addition, it is also recommended that the South African deeds registry implement an electronic system which would allow for the electronic lodging of property transfers.Keywords: e-conveyancing; electronic processes; digitisation of data; supply chain management; integration"

We find small differences in consumer preferences for policies related to different plant breeding methods, with the strongest support for the notion that bioengineered crops should be regulated based on health and environmental outcomes rather than the process used to create new crops. Other survey results reveal support or opposition for genetically engineered food depends on consumers’ perceptions of who created the technology. We also find that food safety concerns related to genetically engineered food are related to perceptions about the distribution of benefits from the technology across the food supply chain."

The purpose of this article is to provide further insights into the adoption of ERP systems and the impacts on firm competence in SCM. We propose a model featuring ERP benefits to firm competences in supply chain management. We also hypothesize that three constructs of ERP benefits positively impact firm competences in SCM. To clarify the relationships among these constructs, structural equation model (SEM) is conducted to examine the model fit and nine hypotheses. The SEM results clearly demonstrate that there exist close interrelations among the benefits of implementing ERP systems and firm competences in SCM. The data from Taiwanese IT firms was collected through interviewing of experts and surveys. The results provide empirical evidence that the beneficial impacts of ERP on the supply chain do lead to better overall SCM competence. That evidence confirms that operational benefits, business process and management benefits, and strategic IT planning benefits of ERP in turn enhance firm competences of SCM in operational process integration, customer and relationship integration, and planning and control process integration. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Virtual integration represents the substitution of ownership with partnership by integrating a set of suppliers through information technology (IT) for tighter supply-chain collaboration. From the systems and control perspectives, this study develops a theory of virtual integration with an empirical model to examine the role that virtual integration plays in facilitating manufacturers to achieve greater manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage. Based on a survey of Taiwanese manufacturing firms, our results show that environmental uncertainty tends to motivate manufacturers to increase their manufacturing flexibility, with both virtual integration and supplier responsiveness playing a vital enabling role. The results demonstrate the importance of supplier responsiveness for manufacturers to gain manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage in supply-chain operations. Environmental uncertainty, thus, might first appear as a threat to a manufacturer, but with the help of IT and more responsive suppliers, such as a threat could be transformed into a competitive edge, as reflected in the manufacturer's higher level of manufacturing flexibility and comparative cost advantage. © 2006 M.E.

The latter are critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and could either lead to their future success or jeopardize their economic survival. To scrutinize the impact of an I4.0 solution on their processes, SMEs need to assess their transformed processes holistically with respect to numerous perspectives. Existing assessment approaches either focus on a single I4.0 solution in isolation, assess exclusively from the technological perspective, or lack an overall procedural and economic impact evaluation. The aim of this contribution is to develop a framework of performance metrics for the holistic impact evaluation of I4.0 solutions on SMEs. In the framework, we consolidate the impacts of technology applications discussed in the literature into 16 main fields of action and define adequate performance metrics to assess each of them. The resulting performance framework combines traditional metrics for the evaluation of supply chain processes i.e., supply chain operations reference-metrics and the global reporting initiative, and extends them with additional performance metrics relevant to the assessment of I4.0 solutions. This framework aims to facilitate and systemize the selection of adequate attributes for the evaluation of I4.0 solutions. Through an illustrative example, we demonstrate the practical utility of the framework and its convenience for the purpose of an assessment."

The research assessed whether supply chain agility is moderated by market, firm, and supply chain factors. Lastly, this study investigated the mediation effects of agility on IT's impact on firm performance. Data were collected from an online survey of supply chain executives at 193 U.S. manufacturing firms from various industries. The results of this study indicate that IT increases the supply chain's ability to sense market changes by improving information quality in terms of adequacy, accuracy, accessibility, and timeliness. IT also increases the supply chain's ability to respond to market changes by developing and executing a coordinated plan with the supply chain in terms of cost, quality, and timeliness. Supply chain agility improves firm performance in terms of sales, market share, profitability, speed to market, and customer satisfaction, albeit in varying degrees. Results also indicate that IT's impact on supply chain agility is not significantly moderated by market, firm, and supply chain factors. This suggests that IT's impact on supply chain agility is applicable to firms operating under a wide variety of circumstances and conditions. Finally, the results indicate that IT's impact on firm performance is through agility. This suggests that firms should consider IT investments that improve the firm's sensing and responding capabilities in order to achieve a significant impact on firm performance. Based on the results of this study, three prioritization strategies are suggested for deploying IT with maximum impact on agility and firm performance.

Design/methodology/approach: Questionnaire survey is conducted to collect data from Vietnamese manufacturing companies in the electronic/electric industry. Collected data were analyzed by using correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis. Findings: This study points out the current situation of implementing supply chain quality management practices in Vietnamese manufacturing companies which are more focused on internal quality management practices than upstream and downstream quality management practices. Correlation and regression analyses that demonstrate the significant linkage between supply chain quality management practices and operational performance are confirmed in this study. Upstream and downstream quality management are found to be the significant predictor for high performance on quality, cost and delivery. Research limitations/implications: This study has some limitations that can be addressed in future studies. The first limitation is the relatively small sample size due to lack of time and resources. These constraint can be overcome in future works by collecting more data in diverse countries and industries to re-examine the framework. Furthermore, larger sample will allow researchers to apply other statistical methods such as path analysis and structural equation modelling, which would provide interesting results. Another limitation is that the collected data in this paper mainly rely on perceptions of the respondents, which may cause individual bias in analysis. To reduce this type of bias, both subjective and objective measurement of scales, especially performance measures, can be used in future studies. Practical implications: This study provides empirical evidences that practitioners can use to improve a specific type of performance, especially in the context of emerging economies. In a turbulent and unpredictable business environment, it is emphasized that quality management should be extended at supply chain level to utilize the capabilities of external partners. In Vietnamese manufacturing firms, implementation of such practices as information technology links, information sharing, supplier involvement and customer involvement would lead to high level of operational performance. Originality/value: Supply chain management and quality management are two fields of study that have gained much attention of researchers. However, the concept of supply chain quality management as well as its impact on business performance have not been fully studied, especially in context of a developing country. Through extensive literature review, this study proposes and tests an analytical framework that characterizes supply chain quality management into three elements: internal quality management, upstream quality management and downstream quality management. Subsequently, their impact on quality, cost and delivery are analyzed to provide better understanding of supply chain quality management in Vietnamese context."

In a business as usual scenario, these impacts will most likely increase, driven by population and economic growth, which will lead to a higher demand for food, and probably for the most environmentally intensive food categories: meat and dairy products. Existing literature suggests deep paradigmatic changes to address this situation, such as (i) large-scale dietary changes on the consumption side, and (ii) structural changes towards more efficient food supply chains on the production side. As both of these measures are related to urban systems, in terms of food consumption habits and the potential of local production, Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture (UPA) may assume a relevant role in food systems sustainability. In order to estimate to what extent the implementation of UPA would play a role in mitigating the environmental impacts of urban food systems, this paper uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to estimate their respective mitigation potential. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Land use (LU) were assessed for per capita Current Average Consumption (CAC) in Lisbon, and this baseline model was subsequently adapted in order to measure the effects of changes: (i) in the diet, through a comparison with the Recommended Healthy Diet (RHD) model; and (ii) in the food supply chain, by measuring the impacts of eliminating losses and wastage across the food supply chain and shortening transportation distances through local food production. The results show that the highest potential for environmental impacts mitigation is related to dietary changes. However, strategies for enhancing the efficiency of the food supply chain are relevant, as reducing losses and wastage, shortening transportation distances and taking into account technology improvements can further increase the mitigation potential."

Inter-company integration and coordination via information technology has become a key to improved supply chain performance. Recent advances in information technology enable firms to manage effectively and inexpensively the coordination of not only the physical flow of materials but also the flow of different types of information such as demand, capacity, inventory, and scheduling, through a supply chain. Despite its importance, little attention has been given in the literature to the issue of measuring the magnitude and the effectiveness of available information that logistics information systems provide. This study provides a generic measure to show how well or to what degree a firm is integrated or ""coupled"" with the members of its supply chain structure from an information flow system perspective. The measure, called degree of supply chain coupling (DSCC), is a 2-tuple index which takes into account both the intensity and extent to which information about demand, capacity, inventory, and scheduling is shared and used by the firm in both directions of the supply chain. We indicate several productive practical uses of the DSCC measure at both macro and micro levels. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss changes in positions and roles related to the implementation of a disruptive technology. Design/methodology/approach: Additive manufacturing could be expected to have different consequences for parties based on their current supply chain positions. The paper therefore investigates companies’ strategies related to various supply chain positions and does so by departing from a position and role point of view. Three business cases related to metal 3D printing - illustrating sub-suppliers, manufacturers and logistics firms - describe as many strategies. Data for the cases were collected through meetings, interviews, seminars and secondary data focusing on both current business activities related to additive manufacturing and scenarios for the future. Findings: The companies attempted to defend their current positions, leading to new roles for them. This disconnects the change of roles from that of positions. The changed roles indicate that all parties, regardless of supply chain positions, would move into competing producing roles, thereby indicating how a disruptive technology may disrupt network structures based on companies’ attempts to defend their positions. Originality/value: The paper contributes to previous research by reporting a disconnect between positions and roles among firms when disruption takes place. The paper further denotes how the investigated firms largely disregarded network consequences at the disruptive stage, caused by the introduction of additive manufacturing. The paper also contributes to research on additive manufacturing by including a business dimension and linking this to positions and roles."

We posit that trust and power are two important antecedents of two types of knowledge sharing between a buyer and supplier, namely technical exchange and technology transfer. To build our research model, a large-scale mail survey was conducted from a contact list of 800 companies provided by the Singapore Logistics Association.

The findings show that both relational governance and virtual integration benefit information visibility. Those results also support both direct and indirect (via information visibility) effects of relational governance on supply chain flexibility. Although failing to affect supply chain flexibility directly, virtual integration can still improve supply chain flexibility with its ability to enhance information visibility.

Strict regulations have compelled the coal power plants to improve environmental performance by reducing carbon emissions and the emission of pollutants. However, due to cost disadvantages, the coal power plants often lack motivation to internalize environmental externalities through investing in green technology. This situation raises a question: is there any alternative to reduce pollutants in operations economically? With a focus on service supply as well as a consideration of government policies, this paper develops a model to investigate the opportunity of outsourcing a pollutant-reduction service to meet the environmental constraint. The service supply chain consists of a coal power plant (end user) and a pollutant-reduction service provider, with the former outsourcing the service to the latter. We study the policy for improving the profit of this service supply chain whereas the benefit allotment is adjusted through outsourcing price negotiation between the two partners. The results show that the green service outsourcing price is interrelated with the government incentive policy which defines the shares of the two partners. Our key contribution lies in integrating the complex factors affecting the supply chain collaboration such as green service, financial feasibility, environmental constraint, government policies, outsourcing price negotiation, and profit sharing. Our research findings have the following implications: considering environmental externalities, the government should motivate the collaboration between supply chain partners; the economic scale of output and sales price subsidy of electricity generation are the primary factors affecting the price of outsourcing green service and, consequently, the allotment of supply chain profits. The study results indicate the collaboration is potentially effective in improving environmental performance."

Software agents are supposed to perform on behalf of their human owners only when equipped with sophisticated negotiation knowledge. To better organize the negotiation knowledge utilized by agents and facilitate agents' adaptive negotiation decision making ability, an ontology-based approach is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the multi-agent assisted supply chain negotiation scheme is presented to configure the general design components of the negotiation system, covering the agent intelligence modules, the knowledge organization method and the negotiation protocol. Then, the ontology-based negotiation knowledge organization method is specified. The negotiation knowledge is separated into shared negotiation ontology and private negotiation ontology to ensure both the agent communicative interoperability and the privacy of strategic knowledge.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential impact of additive manufacturing improvements on the configuration of spare parts supply chains. This goal has been accomplished through scenario modeling of a real-life spare parts supply chain in the aeronautics industry. The spare parts supply chain of the F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet was selected as the case study because the air-cooling ducts of the environmental control system are produced using AM technology. In total, four scenarios are investigated that vary the supply chain configurations and additive manufacturing machine specifications. The reference scenario is based on the spare parts supplier's current practice and the possible future decentralization of production and likely improvements in AM technology. Total operating cost, including downtime cost, is used to compare the scenarios. We found that using current AM technology, centralized production is clearly the preferable supply chain configuration in the case example. However, distributed spare parts production becomes practical as AM machines become less capital intensive, more autonomous and offer shorter production cycles. This investigation provides guidance for the development of additive manufacturing machines and their possible deployment in spare parts supply chains. This study contributes to the emerging literature on AM deployment in supply chains with a real-world case setting and scenario model illustrating the cost trade-offs and critical requirements for technology development.

Policy makers and development practitioners routinely promote awareness campaigns and technical assistance to address mercury use in ASGM; however, this focus obscures other barriers that stand in the way of addressing mercury emissions from the sector. Focused on the town of Relave, in the Ayacucho Region of Southwestern Peru, this paper examines the perspectives and practices of some of the community members who are involved with ASGM activities. It highlights their own views of the challenges related to ASGM and explores the ways in which they are addressing these challenges. Despite their efforts, this paper reveals that there are two key barriers to controlling mercury use in Relave, which lie outside of the communities’ lack of awareness and technological capabilities. These include the deprioritization of mercury use and pollution among community members as compared to other community and public health concerns and inequities in the supply chain that position miners and mineral processors with little to no control over the distribution, use, and emissions of mercury. The implications of these findings for policy decisions, regulatory schemes, and development initiatives are not only relevant to Peru, but are also significant for other countries committed to addressing mercury emissions from ASGM."

Once a consensus is reached, the data for the transactions cannot be changed and becomes the data of record. The storage of data across the network, rather than in one place, and the inability to change data make blockchain a secure way of recording transactions. For the supply chain, this means more consistent records rather than the disputes and correc-tions that occur for many organizations. This technology also has applications for any track-ing that occurs in the supply chain because it enables organizations to maintain accurate and secure data among partners. Blockchain clearly has the potential to improve the way organizations conduct transac-tions and track items within the supply chain. Yet the research conducted by DSCI and APQC indicates that only 1% of the responding organizations are currently using blockchain in their supply chain operations, and only 35% are currently exploring the use of blockchain. Nearly 50% of organizations are neither using nor exploring the use of this technology.

While supply chain risk information plays a crucial role in the implementation and decisions of many of these activities, the importance of a firm's information processing capability to its supply chain risk management effort has received very little attention in the literature. Using information processing theory as the theoretical lens, we argue that a firm's capability in processing supply chain risk information, which comprises supply chain risk information sharing and supply chain risk information analysis, can improve operational performance, and this capability's effectiveness in improving performance is contingent on product-specific uncertainty characteristics (i.e., product complexity and product customization) and environment-related uncertainty characteristics (i.e., technology turbulence and market turbulence). We test the proposed theoretical model using data collected from 350 manufacturing firms in China. The results support that supply chain risk information processing capability comprises two constituent elements and has a positive effect on operational performance. The results also suggest that except for product complexity, all the other posited product-specific and environment-related uncertainty characteristics positively moderate the relationship between supply chain risk information capability and operational performance. We contribute to the literature by developing a theory-driven empirical model that integrates the core concepts of supply chain risk management and information processing theory to generate research findings with theoretical and managerial implications."

Also, direct observation on the companies' operations helped to make the study empirically grounded. We used cross-case analysis to analyse the data. The findings reveal that the local end component of the global supply chain in Tanzania faces many problems compared to that of developed countries; for example, key problems facing Tanzania are: the use of outdated technology in the domestic market, lack of trust, documentation problems, procurement of counterfeit products (e.g., spare parts), and lack of integrated computerised systems to link with the overseas suppliers in the global supply chain, and so on. The insights on problems and practices provide valuable information to researchers and practitioners on the challenges and opportunities in the global supply chain sourcing processes in developing countries.

Malaysia which has abundant sources of biomass, is maximising the efforts to increase renewable energy shares in the current energy mix. Biomass co-firing with coal offers a promising route to less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the zero net greenhouse effect of biomass combustion. This paper presents an integrated spatial optimisation model of biomass co-firing supply chain for existing power generation facilities through the integration of geographical information system (GIS) and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model integrates spatial distributions of biomass supply, locations to build biomass pre-treatment facilities, location-allocation of supply and demand of biomass co-firing supply chain and economic and environmental sounds of biomass co-firing system. The optimisation of the whole supply chain system is conducted with the aim to minimise the overall cost and its emissions while determining the most optimal locations to build pre-treatment facilities to support co-firing power generation. Based on the findings, the cost factors of deploying co-firing technology in existing coal-fired power plant are between 56.61 and 61.65 USD/MWh for 10–50% co-firing rates as compared to the base case electricity generation cost which is at 56.29 USD/MWh. Minimum differences in cost factors are achieved when dedicated fossil fuels scenario is compared to several co-firing scenarios. Up to 8.83 × 106 t of CO2 (equivalent to 46% of CO2 reduction) can be reduced annually in Johor as a result of this practice. This shows that co-firing technology is promising to be implemented in Malaysia while achieving significant emissions reduction target with incentives supported by government."

The question remains: Can solar refrigerators provide value where electrical outages are less frequent? Methods Using a HERMES-generated computational model of the Mozambique routine immunization supply chain, we simulated the use of solar versus electric mains-powered refrigerators (hereafter referred to as “electric refrigerators”) at different locations in the supply chain under various circumstances. Results At their current price premium, the annual cost of each solar refrigerator is 132% more than each electric refrigerator at the district level and 241% more at health facilities. Solar refrigerators provided savings over electric refrigerators when one-day electrical outages occurred more than five times per year at either the district level or the health facilities, even when the electric refrigerator holdover time exceeded the duration of the outage. Two-day outages occurring more than three times per year at the district level or more than twice per year at the health facilities also caused solar refrigerators to be cost saving. Lowering the annual cost of a solar refrigerator to 75% more than an electric refrigerator allowed solar refrigerators to be cost saving at either level when one-day outages occurred more than once per year, or when two-day outages occurred more than once per year at the district level or even once per year at the health facilities. Conclusion Our study supports WHO and Gavi guidelines. In fact, solar refrigerators may provide savings in total cost per dose administered over electrical refrigerators when electrical outages are less frequent. Our study identified the frequency and duration at which electrical outages need to occur for solar refrigerators to provide savings in total cost per dose administered over electric refrigerators at different solar refrigerator prices."

Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical case studies of CLSC exemplars are used to discuss the theoretical relevance of these views. Findings: The paper shows how strategic resources help companies in two sectors achieve successful CLSC designs. Strategic supply chain collaboration is an important success factor but also presents a number of challenges. The NRBV is used to explain the importance of new resources in technology, knowledge and relationships and stresses the role of DCs to constantly address changes in the business environment to renew these strategic resources. Research limitations/implications: This research elaborates on NRBV theory related to CLSCs and reinforces the inclusion of DCs. It specifies the application of NRBV in the context of textiles and carpet manufacture and highlights the inherent conflicts in seeking value while moving towards sustainable development. Practical implications: Investments in technical and operational resources are required to create CLSCs. Pure closed-loop applications are impractical, requiring relationships with multiple external partners to obtain supply and demand for recycled products. Social implications: CLSCs may provide opportunities for social enterprises or third sector organizations collaborating with manufacturers.

This is particularly true for firms competing internationally, where the complexity of the supply chain must be managed within a global network. To explore the linkage between supply chain complexity and delivery, a two-dimensional framework is proposed that conceptualizes the degree of complexity embedded in a supply chain along two major dimensions: 1) form of technology and 2) nature of information processing. Technology is characterized using a conventional operations strategy framework of structural and infrastructural elements. In contrast, information processing captures both the level of complicatedness and of uncertainty that exists in the supply chain. Collectively, these two dimensions create a two-by-two framework that defines supply chain complexity and provides a strong theoretical basis for linking different aspects of complexity to delivery performance. An exploratory empirical investigation using an international database focused on immediate upstream and downstream echelons of a supply chain at the firm level. Results show strong support for the linkages between delivery performance and both complicatedness of the product/process and uncertainty of the management systems. In contrast, little evidence was found that greater product variety and more complicated supply networks adversely affected performance. Thus, management initiatives to improve delivery performance are best focused on improving informational flows within the supply chain and leveraging new process technologies that offer flexibility to respond to uncertainty."

This paper provides an updated estimate of the value of goods produced. It then reviews the literature on additive manufacturing costs and identifies those instances in the literature where this technology is cost-effective. The paper then goes on to propose an approach for examining and understanding the societal costs and benefits of this technology both from a monetary viewpoint and a resource consumption viewpoint. The final section discusses the trends in the adoption of additive manufacturing. Globally, there is an estimated $667 million in value added produced using additive manufacturing, which equates to 0.01 % of total global manufacturing value added. US value added is estimated as $241 million. Current research on additive manufacturing costs reveals that it is cost-effective for manufacturing small batches with continued centralized production; however, with increased automation distributed production may become cost-effective. Due to the complexities of measuring additive manufacturing costs and data limitations, current studies are limited in their scope. Many of the current studies examine the production of single parts and those that examine assemblies tend not to examine supply chain effects such as inventory and transportation costs along with decreased risk to supply disruption. The additive manufacturing system and the material costs constitute a significant portion of an additive manufactured product; however, these costs are declining over time. The current trends in costs and benefits have resulted in this technology representing 0.02 % of the relevant manufacturing industries in the USA; however, as the costs of additive manufacturing systems decrease, this technology may become widely adopted and change the supplier, manufacturer, and consumer interactions. An examination in the adoption of additive manufacturing reveals that for this technology to exceed $4.4 billion in 2020, $16.0 billion in 2025, and $196.8 billion in 2035, it would need to deviate from its current trends of adoption."

Being very easy to grow within two to three months and hold for as long as six months as fruit in the storage, it has been encouraged to be grown in Samarahan, which is considered a food belt in the northern region of Sarawak, Malaysia especially for Kuching. However, in reality, there is a limitation in the commercial production as the pumpkin is very much dependent on the market demand as the utilization has been limited to the consumption of fresh product. Thus this creates a bottleneck in the supply chain resulting in large stock being stored in the farmers’ places. This study explored a diversified supply chain model from the traditional pumpkin supply chain in Samarahan which follows a simple supply chain that is short and linear linking the farmers who are the producer to the consumer through the middleman and the retailers. The research supply chain model adopted a three level chain which had the combination of level one and level two supply chains, characterized more by the producers-collector-processing industry-consumers. The diversification of the supply chain resulted in establishing an added value link from the producers to the consumers with the integration of the processing industry adopting low technology of processing raw pumpkin to dehydrated powder form with the reduction of the need of a storage space by 80% and extending the shelf-life. The research model adopted the concept of food added value supply chain or value-based chain in order to achieve effective solutions regarding the production, marketing, distribution and sale of their produce."

Managing healthcare records, linking the related healthcare silos and most importantly hospitals and the hospital-supplier linkages have occupied the focal point of discussion in the recent past. Adoption of digital technologies has made headway into the healthcare space. Technologies like Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms are being adopted by the hospitals for a better sync between them and their suppliers, which in turn help them to improve the care-quality and benefits down the line to their patients, besides boosting their own performance measures. EHR and ERP adoption literatures are gradually progressing, and at this juncture, the current study, well-grounded and drawing logical support from two base theories i.e., Cybernetic control theory and Resource-based view, puts forward and rationally links the antecedentconsequence relationship variables. This study, based on detailed extant review of literature, aims at eliciting a nuanced view of how EHR and ERP adoption in the hospital supply chain boosts the patient care quality. This study puts forth a conceptual framework linking the technology adoption (EHR and ERP) to healthcare performance, showcasing patient care quality as the intervening step. This study also puts forth rationally-linked propositions which might provide hospital managers with a better elicited understanding of the gains of EHR and ERP in hospital supply chain and healthcare network context.

The framework suggests that supply chain flexibility should be implemented and managed using a three-stage approach: required flexibility identification, implementation and shared responsibility, and feedback and control. Design/methodology/approach - The major components of the proposed framework are based on a review of research in the manufacturing flexibility literature as well as the limited research in supply chain flexibility. The strengths and weaknesses of these frameworks, combined with a published empirical study were analyzed to identify the important issues that must be considered when implementing and managing supply chain flexibility, and those components that need to be incorporated into a new integrated framework. Findings - This framework was constructed by synthesizing the strengths of other conceptual frameworks. As a result, the major components of the framework are supported by the current research on the implementation and management of manufacturing flexibility, as well as the current literature on supply chain management. Research limitations/implications - Empirical research is needed to examine the nature and level of responsibility sharing among different supply chain partners as suggested in this framework. It is also important to empirically investigate what constitutes flexibility in the supply chain taxonomy in various industries. Another issue of managerial interest concerns the way different supply chain flexibility types relate to one another, and whether supply chain organizations should acquire certain supply chain flexibilities as a pre-requisite for developing others. Further studies are necessary to further explain the contribution made by key enablers, such as information technology and communication, the internet, process technology, and training and labor skills, towards the acquisition of supply chain flexibility. Practical implications - The implication of this new conceptual framework for managers is that it is easy to understand and is based on best practices in the research literature on manufacturing flexibility and supply chain management. Originality/value - To researchers, this framework provides a springboard for conducting exploratory and confirmatory research on the process of implementing and managing supply chain flexibility. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

This concept paper puts forward a conceptual framework for sustainable development based on the notion of ""intelligence"" for Waste-to-Energy (WtE) strategies. The pillars of intelligence are defined and the quadruple helix model for energy transitions based on waste management is established. The ""smart"" nodes of a WtE supply chain management are analytically presented and discussed. Nevertheless, the intelligent notion for a supply chain cannot stand on its own. Systematical support of a participatory process is needed via Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools and e-techniques to be promoted for collective facilitation and sustainable management. This process encompasses intelligent residents and professionals as producers of waste and smart managers to supervise the supply chain towards sustainable management of energy and waste resources. It is argued that the ICT participatory interface has a multiplying effect, especially when adopting the middle pathway approach in local and/or decentralized level towards smart energy production from waste. Innovative solutions to maximize waste efficiency through the collaborative power of ICT networks is critical to be deployed within local communities. These can be based on internet of things, big data, operational modeling, complex systems science, games and narratives, and social networks. The conceptual framework presented herein provides a basis for decision support towards sustainable development and interaction through a creative pathway of collaboration applicable to all the levels of potential synergies. Main conclusions and future challenges indicate that more research effort is required by the scientific community to leverage on the collaborative power of social networks and to efficiently apply ICT methods for adopting the ""socially-oriented"" middle pathway approach within communities' empowerment. Only on this basis may the tale of two challenges have a happy end, both for energy transition and waste management."

Modernising information communication technology is a widely hailed solution to easing this problem. In this paper, the importance of marrying hard and soft infrastructure for optimum efficiency is buttressed. This is based on empirical evidence from surveys involving 345 participants on four road entry points to Zimbabwe's territorial borders. Participants are truck drivers and small and medium entrepreneurs. Findings trace the perpetuation of delays, to failure to tie together hard and soft infrastructure components of entry point management systems. This consequently disturbs the supply chain of goods in the Southern African development community.

In order to realize the optimal scheduling and automatic identification of port logistics service supply chain information, it is necessary to design the contract coordination management of port logistics service supply chain information. A coordinated management model of port logistics service supply chain information contract based on grid area reconstruction learning clustering is proposed. The fuzzy association rule scheduling technology is used to sample the port logistics service supply chain information, and the port logistics service supply chain information collected by RFID is processed by information fusion. The autocorrelation statistical regression analysis method is used to extract the correlation statistical features of port logistics service supply chain information, and the matching filtering method is used to detect the redundant features of port logistics service supply chain information for interference suppression filtering. The purified port logistics service supply chain information is reconstructed by phase space reconstruction technology, and the reconstructed data is classified and identified by grid area reconstruction learning clustering classifier. The contract coordination management and automatic retrieval of port logistics service supply chain information are realized. The simulation results show that the automatic classification of port logistics service supply chain information contract coordination management is good, and the fuzzy clustering ability is strong, which improves the coordination management ability of port logistics service supply chain information contract."

We analyze how FG and SFG substitution, secondary recycling, supply extension and research and development (R&D) affect dynamic variables such as the price level, supply and demand on each stage to determine the effectiveness of each strategy for mining companies, SFG and FG producers. FG and SFG substitution show the highest potential for mitigating supply unavailability. Substitution is especially beneficial for FG producers. It also has the advantage of offering a quick development of alternatives for reducing REE supply unavailability risk. Due to the fact that the necessary infrastructure and technology are not available, secondary recycling shows only a low mitigation potential for FG companies. It was shown that mining companies do not invest proactively in supply capacities beyond China, as our simulation shows that it took 6 years until a new REE mine was opened. R&D is identified as a key element for REE mining companies, SFG and FG producers when it comes to developing alternative products and recycling techniques. Nonetheless, SFG producers face huge difficulties when trying to develop substitutes as alternative materials are not present."

At the same time, a burgeoning body of supply chain research, largely overlooked by marketing researchers, has emerged promoting the benefits of cooperation in technology-enabled supply chain integration. This study aims to investigate the confluence of these streams. Specifically it aims to consider the effects of retailer supply chain technology mandates on supplier financial performance. Design/methodology/approach - The design and method is a secondary data event analysis including cross-sectional regression analysis. Findings - The event analysis findings indicate suppliers affected by Wal-Mart's 2003 RFID mandate experienced net gains in abnormal stock returns. Subsequent cross-sectional regression analysis show abnormal returns were stronger for suppliers with greater cash flow and for more dependent suppliers. Practical implications - Study results suggested firms with stronger cash flows are better able to absorb the unexpected costs of complying with the retailer mandate. Additionally, the findings indicate mandate-associated positive abnormal returns were more pronounced for suppliers with a larger percentage of sales through the Wal-Mart channel. This means that a dependent supplier that follow technology mandates by power retailers will potentially receive above average stock returns.

The existing models from previous research are unable to map the benefits of cloud computing from the perspectives of multiple actors and highlight where exactly the benefits occur along the supply chain. The network business model is proposed to facilitate the adoption of the cloud computing technology that maps four key components namely value, activity, actor, and benefit. A case study involving a logistics company and a cloud solution provider was conducted to observe the adaptability and the rigidity of the model. Rather than going head-to-head with the license-based model such as ERP, cloud-based solutions integrate such systems and create an end-to-end visibility across the supply chain, which includes procurement, distribution, and inventory visibilities."

The reality in the field, however, is that the deployment of these technologies can be problematic due to user issues, such as interpretation of data or embedding within processes, and organisational issues, such as business change to gain value from asset analysis. 13 experts from the field of remote condition monitoring, asset management and predictive analytics across multiple sectors were interviewed to ascertain their experience of supplying data-driven applications. The results of these interviews are summarised as a framework based on a predictive maintenance project lifecycle covering project motivations and conception, design and development, and operation. These results identified critical themes for success around having a target- or decision-led, rather than data-led, approach to design; long-term resourcing of the deployment; the complexity of supply chains to provide data-driven solutions and the need to maintain knowledge across the supply chain; the importance of fostering technical competency in end-user organisations; and the importance of a maintenance-driven strategy in the deployment of data-driven asset management.

Working with the enormous volume of data (or Big Data, as it is popularly known as) for extraction of useful information to support decision making is one of the sources of competitive advantage for organizations today. Enterprises are leveraging the power of analytics in formulating business strategy in every facet of their operations to mitigate business risk. Volatile global market scenario has compelled the organizations to redefine their supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, we have delineated the relevance of Big Data and its importance in managing end to end supply chains for achieving business excellence. A Big Data-centric architecture for SCM has been proposed that exploits the current state of the art technology of data management, analytics and visualization. The security and privacy requirements of a Big Data system have also been highlighted and several mechanisms have been discussed to implement these features in a real world Big Data system deployment in the context of SCM. Some future scope of work has also been pointed out."

Two important aspects, knowledge spillovers and cartelization, have a considerable impact on firms’ cooperative innovation performance. This paper studies cooperative innovation decisions in a two-level supply chain including an upstream firm and a downstream firm with knowledge spillovers (natural or perfect) and uncertain technology efficiency. To investigate the effects of knowledge spillovers and cartelization, four innovation modes, namely, non-cooperative innovation, innovation cartel, research joint venture and research joint venture cartel, are examined. We obtain several findings: (i) enhancing either firm's knowledge spillover benefits both firms and the whole supply chain, and the profits of the firms and the chain reach the maximum when the two firms perfectly share their knowledge; (ii) cartelization can help upstream and downstream firms achieve a win–win scenario in a Pareto zone, but the supply chain always benefits; and (iii) both knowledge spillovers and cartelization are beneficial for the supply chain when the demand elasticity is not too small, specifically, with the research joint venture cartel mode being the best and the non-cooperation mode being the worst. Moreover, we extend the model to involve a general probability distribution of stochastic technology efficiency and find that high uncertainty in technology efficiency leads to lower profit for the downstream firm; we also relax a general cost function of technological innovation and discuss the robustness of the theoretical results."

Among the strategies for CO2 diminishment, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is considered as the key option. The objective of this work is to develop an optimization-based assessment framework that aims to incorporate CO2 storage and CO2 utilization into an integrated framework. To achieve this goal, a superstructure network including all the sections of CCUS supply chain is proposed, which includes CO2 capture, transportation, storage and utilization with 15 candidate conversion process paths. Based on this superstructure, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a supply chain of CCUS is developed. CO2 would be stored underground and/or utilized to produce chemical products through candidate conversion paths. Finally, a case with real data of large emission sources in Northeast China is studied. Three different scenarios are investigated, according to key constraints on CCUS network: CO2 emission source, raw material limits and products demands limits. Results show that adsorption is the preferred capture technology at relative high flue gas flow rate and high CO2 concentration. Storing CO2 is the recommended approach compared with utilization from the point of economy, however, carbon utilization could be a more sustainable option and may generate a carbon-neutral cycle. With the increase of CO2 utilization, the cost of CCUS supply chain also increase (Scenario A: 2.49 billion $/y, Scenario B: 2.76 billion $/y, Scenario C: 2.85 billion $/y)."

This paper assesses the potential for reducing the climate impact of road construction. The study is structured as a participatory integrated assessment with involvement from key stakeholders in the supply chain, supported by energy and material flow mapping, an extensive literature review and a scenario analysis. The results indicate that it is technically possible to halve road construction CO2 emissions with today's best available technologies and practices, to abate more than three quarters of the emissions by 2030 and achieve close to net zero emissions by 2045. Realising the current potential would rely on sufficient availability of sustainably produced second-generation biofuels, indicating a need to speed up the implementation of alternative abatement measures, including optimization of material use and mass handling requirements, increased recycling of steel, asphalt and aggregates and enhanced use of alternative binders in concrete. Policy measures and procurement strategies should be aligned to support these measures with a clear supply chain focus. For deep decarbonization several key opportunities and obstacles for realisation of breakthrough technologies for basic industry are highlighted – including electrification and carbon capture for steel and cement, and hybridisation and electrification for heavy transport and construction equipment. There is a clear need to prepare for deeper abatement and associated transformative shifts already now and to carefully consider the pathway of getting there while avoiding pitfalls along the way, such as overreliance on biofuels or cost optimizations which cannot be scaled up to the levels required."

Given the inherent difficulty in assessing supply chain performance and the widespread use of different performance models, such as the SCOR and balanced scorecard, we developed a list of performance indicators. Factor analysis produced 7 supply chain performance factors: supplier, inventory, distribution, ordering, plan, sales, and forecasting.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an analytical model that places supply chain performance indicators as dependent variables in a hierarchical regression equation with RFID variables as independent variables. Results found that the implementation of RFID practices significantly affect the supply chain performance in the following areas: supplier, inventory, distribution, plan, sales, and forecasting.

In response to the risk in the agricultural products supply chain and to improve services, the traceable platform of the agricultural products supply chain is highly required. Quality problems of agricultural products could occur in every aspect of the agricultural products supply chain, including breeding, processing, distribution, and sale. So not only policies, but also technical supports are needed to ensure the quality and safety of agricultural products and to bottom out the safety hazards. In response to these issues, this paper took broiler as the object of study and designed and developed a information system platform of the agricultural products supply chain based on near field communication (NFC) and internet of things. The integration applications of NFC technology and internet of things have become a focus research issues at home and abroad. In this paper, we reviewed supply chain information systems research progress of domestic agricultural products, summarized the key function of information technology in the agricultural supply chain and information systems platform, and analyzed the application feasibility of NFC technology in the agricultural supply chain information systems. In this paper, we designed chicken supply chain information system framework based on the integration applications of NFC and internet of things, and designed hierarchical, data structure, information processing of information system. This information systems platform has the following characteristics:1) It had a monitoring function of broiler farming, and can track and trace all aspects of information from breeding, production, processing, and distribution to sale; 2) It bringed out informationization on the production and management of enterprises, and achieved all-the-way monitoring of broiler's quality and safety through the construction of information technology; 3) It had three functions including feed and culture environment etc monitoring, early warning of broiler's epidemic, and early warning of the risks of broiler's quality and safety, which facilitated enterprise management and supervision of broiler's quality for quality supervision departments; 4) Consumers can inquire and complain about broiler product information with the NFC-enabled mobile phone or device; 5) NFC technology can read and write agricultural production, distribution and sale data automatically and can record and store all product information, which completely solve the problem of information distortion of traditional RFID technology; 6) NFC technology can solve the poor security problems of traditional RFID tag. NFC tags required to write data in every aspect of production and circulation, every vendor had the permissions of modify the corresponding sectors only, and prohibited the manufacturers modify data writing by time constraints. When writing data, vendors used geographic information encryption, scrolling encryption, RSA or EDS, and ensured the integrity and authenticity of data. The results showed that the supply chain information system based on the application of NFC technology enabled the broiler supply chain information full record, ensured the safety of each node information of broiler supply chain, improved the efficiency of broiler supply chain, and provided trace and recall examples for other agricultural products."

The empirical model is tested using LISREL. Findings - The results show that as variance in supply chain lead-times increases, the financial performance of the organization decreases. Of equal significance, the results show that average supply chain lead-times have no direct impact on financial performance. The results also indicate that demand uncertainty associates with greater supply chain lead-time variance and that production technology routineness associates with lower supply chain lead-time variance. Product complexity and organizational size have no impact on supply chain lead-time variance or supply chain lead-time average. Research limitations/implications - The research is an initial effort to understand variance in supply chain systems. An ongoing challenge in this area is operationalization of measures and data collection techniques that go beyond a single firm and examine a network of organizations cooperating in a value-added supply chain. Practical implications - The results suggest that managing the variance in a supply chain system may be more important to an organization's financial performance than managing averages. Originality/value - This is particularly significant since organizations often act contrary to these findings, focusing scarce resources on reducing average lead-times rather than on reducing variability in supply chain lead-times."

Today, an emerging worldwide trend in supply chain management is a shift of the focus from classical supply chains towards DSC, which leverages new solutions to generate new sources of revenue and additional business value for organizations. Recognizing these potential benefits, today's modern organizations now interact with their dealers through DSC processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness in their production and delivery operations. Supplier selection is one of the crucial processes that has been affected by the digitalization of supply chain management. Addressing multi-criteria nature of the supplier selection process, this article introduces a new DSC approach for the first time to support the supplier selection process. This approach develops a group decision making (GDM) method in an uncertain environment. This methodology also considers decision makers when they are under pressure and/or lack expertise during the evaluation process. The proposed framework integrates for the first time the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IVIF) Sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) under a GDM environment.

However, when provided with only a portion of supply-chain data, even for a product with a straightforward supply chain, it was expected that interoperability of the systems will be lacking and that there will be difficulty collaborating to identify sources and/or recipients of potentially contaminated product. IFT provided supply-chain data for one complex product to 9 product tracing technology providers, and then compared and contrasted their effectiveness at analyzing product tracing information to identify the contaminated ingredient and likely source, as well as distribution of the product. A vertically integrated foodservice restaurant agreed to work with IFT to secure data from its supply chain for both a multi-ingredient and a simpler product. Potential multi-ingredient products considered included canned tuna, supreme pizza, and beef tacos. IFT ensured that all supply-chain data collected did not include any proprietary information or information that would otherwise identify the supply-chain partner who provided the information prior to sharing this information with product tracing technology providers. The 9 traceability solution providers who agreed to participate in this project have their systems deployed in a wide range of sectors within the food industry including, but not limited to, livestock, dairy, produce, fruits, seafood, meat, and pork; as well as in pharmaceutical, automotive, retail, and other industries. Some have also been implemented across the globe including Canada, China, USA, Norway, and the EU, among others. This broad commercial use ensures that the findings of this work are applicable to a broad spectrum of the food system. Six of the 9 participants successfully completed the data entry phase of this test. To verify successful data entry for these 6, a demo or screenshots of the data set from each system's user interface was requested. Only 4 of the 6 were able to provide us with this evidence for verification. Of the 6 that completed data entry and moved on to the scenarios phase of the test, 5 were able to provide us with the responses to the scenarios. Time metrics were useful for evaluating the scalability and usability of each technology. Scalability was derived from the time it took to enter the nonstandardized data set into the system (ranges from 7 to 11 d). Usability was derived from the time it took to query the scenarios and provide the results (from a few hours to a week). The time was measured in days it took for the participants to respond after we supplied them all the information they would need to successfully execute each test/scenario. Two of the technology solution providers successfully implemented and participated in a proof-of-concept interoperable framework during Year 2 of this study. While not required, they also demonstrated this interoperability capability on the FSMA-mandated food product tracing pilots for the U.S. FDA. This has significant real-world impact since the demonstration of interoperability enables U.S. FDA to obtain evidence on the importance and impact of data-sharing moving forward. Another real-world accomplishment is the modification or upgrade of commercial technology solutions to enhance or implement interoperability. As these systems get deployed by clients in the food industry, interoperability will no longer be an afterthought but will be built into their traceability systems. In turn, industry and regulators will better understand the capabilities of the currently available technologies, and the technology provider community will identify ways in which their systems may be further developed to increase interoperability and utility. © 2013 Institute of Food Technologists®"

We seek answers to the research question, ‘How should a blockchain enabled supply chain be designed?’ Guided by the theory of business model, we explore how a group of supply chain actors collectively designs and pilots a blockchain solution that addresses the supply chain transparency and provenance problem. Our research is one of the very few longitudinal empirical studies to offer in-depth evidence about how blockchain is deployed in complex multi-tier supply chain networks. In compliance with DSR research paradigm, we make contributions at three levels: designing and instantiating the blockchain architect and proving its utility in addressing the target problem; developing a set of design principles as a mid-range theory that can be applied and tested in different blockchain supply chain contexts; and refining and extending the kernel theory of business value at supply chain network level."

Using data from 205 plants, which were collected in conjunction with the High Performance Manufacturing project, the degree of supplier and customer integration and its match with the implemented IT instruments supporting interorganizational collaboration are investigated empirically. Different types of integration are differentiated from each other with the help of factor, percentile and cluster analyses. The focus and degree of IT integra- tion is measured for each of the resulting groups and the alignment of both aspects is analyzed with the help of an approach referred to as the angles of integration. With respect to supply chain integration and IT implementation, the analysis ofdifferent integration strategies shows that most ofthe plants do not align their IT implementation with their supply chain strategy. The paper helps companies to evaluate the alignment of their use of IT techniques with their global supply chain management emphases. Additionally, possible rea- sons for a potential missmatch of functional strategies are discussed giving managers insights for dealing more effectively with a strategic alignment. Furthermore, it refines an existing framework for the comparison of different supply chain integration strategies and applies it with IT. Based on the angles of integration, the match of supply chain integration and IT is investigated by statistical analyses. Keywords:"

It has been reported that organisations need to integrate their Information Technology (IT) infrastructures to support the integration of their supply chains to increase their efficiency. However, the current research suggests that Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs), due to their lack of expertise and financial resources to invest in the necessary technologies, seem to need further support from the government in their efforts to adopt IT. Therefore, the role of the government is fundamental in supporting them to adopt supply chain management technologies, especially in geographical contexts such as this of Taiwan. A case study is therefore carried out in this paper to study an initiative taken in Taiwan by the government in order to help the supply chain integration of Taiwanese IT manufacturing companies. The findings suggest that the adoption of IT by SMEs (i.e. suppliers) is very much dependent on external forces (resource-dependency view), thus the government has a very important role to play when it comes to supporting SMEs to join supply chain networks. In doing so, this research provides a broader understanding of the phenomenon of e-government initiatives to support supply chain integration in practice."

In this paper, we examine a recent innovative program that exploits a ubiquitous mobile phone technology to acquire demand information directly from consumers. However, the information acquired from consumers is a censored version of the information that could be acquired through supply chain collaboration. We present a simple procedure to ""recover"" the true demand information over time from that acquired from consumers. We show that the proposed procedure is indeed an effective substitute for supply chain collaboration in a highly variable but low demand situation where the fill rate is high. Using real-life data from a manufacturer in China that has implemented a mobile app (WeChat) program for learning consumer demand information, we demonstrate the value of such a mobile app program can be substantial."

Findings - Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) is the most recent prolific management initiative that provides supply chain collaboration and visibility. By following CPFR, companies can dramatically improve supply chain effectiveness with demand planning, synchronized production scheduling, logistic planning, and new product design. CPFR will force suppliers to innovate, building on strong one-to-one relationships that will drive smarter ways of doing things. Most companies and industries can benefit from CPFR. However, companies that experience variation in demand, buy or sell a product on a periodic basis, and those that deal in highly differentiated or branded products will benefit the most. Practical implications - Practitioners can gain first-hand knowledge of the CPFR model, technology and factors influencing adoption.

While planning systems usually follow a single straightforward production planning process, this paper proposes that partners adapt together their local planning process (i.e. planning behaviours) to the different situations met in the supply chain environment. Because each partner can choose different behaviour and all behaviours will have an impact on the overall performance, it is difficult to know which is preferable for each partner to increase their performance. Using agent-based technology, simulation experiments have been undertaken to verify if multi-behaviour planning agents who can change planning behaviours to adapt to their environment can increase supply chain performance. These agents have been implemented in an agent-based planning platform, using a case study illustrating a lumber supply chain.

The technology is already there and has hit the ground. It affects all areas of the value chain, the established supply chain and operations processes, and the metrics a company utilizes. In summary, proven approaches to supply chain performance management need to be rethought to cope with increasing customer requirements, technological advancements, and ongoing challenges in supply chain complexity as well as pressure to increase revenues and profit margins."

Different attributes of blockchain technology increase trust through traceability and transparency ability of goods, data and financial resources within any transaction. Regardless of initial uncertainty about this technology, government and many major enterprises and firms have recently examined the adoption and improvement of this technology in several areas of applications, from social, legal and finance industries to manufacturing, design and supply-chain networks. An interesting research problem in this new era is that of determining provenance. At present, goods which are produced and transported using complicated medium supply chains, in this type of supply chain it is impossible to evaluate the provenance of physical goods. We have an interest in the blockchain as there are numerous favored use cases of blockchain especially for provenance tracking. In this paper we review the basics features of the blockchain along with its type like permission less and permissioned blockchain. Then discussed the need of provenance of assets in supplychain as it increase the trust of the customer and proposed a process and architecture for providing the data provenance in supply chain with blockchain using smart contract."

The researched control towers were built and still they are developed. The business frequently changes and requires control towers to be adjusted, reengineered and adaptive. The researched control towers are needed to keep control over supply chain while it is transforming. There is a differentiation between the supply chain control towers, logistic services control towers and reverse supply chain control towers.

This paper aims at investigating this aspect of supply chain planning simulation through the use of theoretical contributions found in the field of simulation, systems theory, distributed decision making and agent-based software engineering. More specifically, this paper first proposes a conceptual framework for modeling ""distributed agent-based Advanced Planning and Scheduling"" (d-APS).

Whereas prior literature has identified a number of potential contributing factors and recommended such remedies as information sharing enabled by information technology (IT) or electronic linkage (EL), few studies have provided empirical support. We use industry-level data to examine whether EL use with buyer and supplier industries helps reduce the bullwhip effect as measured by inventory-demand variance ratio. Our major findings are that (1) EL use with supplier industries reduces the bullwhip effect, whereas (2), surprisingly, EL use with buyer industries increases it, but (3) this adverse effect tends to be mitigated by IT use. These findings point to the possible asymmetric effects of EL use in supply chains and provide a different perspective to the existing conclusions in the literature that EL use improves performance. Combining the above results, we have learned that the use of EL tends to behave differently depending on whether it is used upstream or downstream in the supply chain.

We construct a formal Bayesian forecast updating model and find out that information sharing benefits the supplier but hurts the retailer. Demand information sharing has no impact on global emission reduction but significantly reduces the “wasted emission”, i.e., emission from producing unwanted products. Upgrading manufacturing technology provides an incentive for the retailer to share information with a highly cost-efficient supplier to achieve the reduction of global emission and wasted emission. Meanwhile, consumers’ green awareness strengthens this effect. We extend the model to investigate the impact of additional ordering cost in QR mode and risk-averse decision making behaviors, assessing information sharing's effects in these cases.

CPD process improvements, in terms of complex engineering design and delivery, still lack a lot more variance to be addressed on the ""better, faster and cheaper"" paradigm for efficient communication and information exchange flow processes. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents employing social network theory analysis and statistical Pearson (r) correlation analysis in a triangulation approach to a proposed optimum conceptual information technology systems' architecture and a ""best practice"" information flow process toward enhancing an industrial sustainable competitive advantage. Closed-end questionnaires were used to collect data for the scale or level of communication network from a sample size of eight Ship Power supply chain network complex engineering design and delivery systems-design teams with at least five members from each team. Findings - Two extremely interesting findings and observations were identified from the analysis carried out (isolates and close-harmonic analysis) as well as the findings from the hypotheses' testing. These essential analyses of the engineering systems-design teams were conducted by using the triangulation or mixedmethod described in the abstract methodology identified above. Originality/value - Effective and efficient real-time communication is seen as the vehicle for effective organization management. Although there may be some studies on effective technical communication in organizational and enterprise supply chain management settings, this research identifies a new robust and extensive analysis and feasible solutions to most of the communication bottlenecks and inefficient socioindustrial information flow processes, which need enhancement for industrial competitive advantage. Furthermore, the contribution of this paper further enhances the level 4 implementation aspect of the supply chain operation reference model in a replicable industry-specific perspective."

At present, China fresh produce market for primary agricultural products, food processing and consumer demand increases year by year, but the infrastructure and information technology applications of fresh produce supply chain are behind, resulting in high loss of fresh produce throughout the supply chain in the circulation process, as well as low efficiency and poor reliability of the information, and therefore it is difficult to meet the needs of the modern market of fresh produce. In recent years, the consumption of fresh agriculture products has been continuing to rise with the development of society and the growth in people' s living standard. However, an increasing number of safety problems like poisoning and polluting have been triggered because of the quality problem of fresh agriculture products, which directly influences consumers' health and environmental security. Eventually, it has aroused widespread concern in the whole society. The discontinuity of fresh agriculture product supply chain information is one of the important reasons for the emergence of faulty products. The backwardness of data acquisition equipment and means in each link of fresh agriculture product supply chain, and the data in key link being not able to be collected due to environmental factors, are the main reasons for discontinuous information of fresh agriculture product supply chain. The paper first analyzes data collecting equipments of fresh agriculture product supply chain and its corresponding working conditions. Then, based on near field communication (NFC), bei dou system (BDS) and global system for mobile communications (GSM), it develops the integration technology data collection terminal of fresh agriculture product supply chain. The integration applications of NFC technology and Internet of things have become a focus research issue at home and abroad. In this paper, authors review the research progress of supply chain information systems of domestic agricultural products; summarize the key function of information technology in the agricultural supply chain and information system platform; and analyze the application feasibility of NFC technology in the agricultural supply chain information systems. The data collection terminal mainly includes four modules, namely NFC module, CPU (central processing unit) module, Bei Dou module, GSM module as well as its electrical system. When the data terminal writes data, it simultaneously writes BDS encrypted data to NFC label through NFC chip PN532, and then through GSM module, it transmits the encrypted data to the backend database in text message; finally, it transmits the data information to node enterprises platform by RS232, thus achieving three copies of the backup on fresh agriculture product data information. By means of the advantages of Internet of things and sensor networks, the data terminal implements automatic and intelligent data acquisition and encryption in every link of fresh agriculture product supply chain. And on this basis, it meets the changing needs of data acquisition and storage during the production process, reduces the degree of information asymmetry among node enterprises and enhances the productivity of node enterprises. In short, the data terminal lays the foundation for the fresh agriculture product traceability and has practical value. Compared with other acquisition systems, the biggest difference the terminal system has is that the system not only has the function to read the data, but also has a tag write capability, and can read the offline data stored inside the NFC memory chip carried by the system itself. The terminal reads in extreme environments. Although the speed is reduced by from 10% to 25%, the saving rate is still at 100%, fully meeting the needs of data acquisition. The terminal can achieve the information continuousness between the nodes of the enterprise, and provide the reference for the realization of fresh produce traceability."

This suggests that incumbent firms in this industry have a vital role in the development and commercialization process of renewable energy technologies. This paper provides a comparative analysis of oil and gas firms' strategies regarding solar PV technology investments, a renewable energy technology that has seen explosive growth of late. The main aim is to examine the strategic approach of incumbent firms in the oil and gas industry towards the development and commercialization of solar PV technology. To investigate this, a multiple case study has been conducted within the European oil industry, focusing on the three largest oil and gas firms: BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Total. Findings show that oil and gas firms have difficulties with integrating solar PV technology in their supply chain. The analysis suggests that it is uncertain whether all oil and gas firms will abandon solar completely, as this depends to what extent they are able to generate profits. Nevertheless, there is currently a trend in the oil industry of leaving solar and positioning towards a 'recarbonization' of business activities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on an in-depth literature review and a classification of the main contributions regarding the assessment of RFId applications. The impact of RFId technology on supply chain processes has been modelled using an activity-based approach. An extensive, six-month discussion and refinement process with the logistics and supply chain managers of 30 FMCG companies is conducted to validate the model and to collect the required inputs. Findings - Pallet- and case-level taggings have been explored. The former scenario shows limited benefits, whereas the actual potential of RFId becomes clear in the latter. The profitability of these projects is significantly affected by the costs of RFId tags and by the characteristics of the base-line supply chain in terms of efficiency, quality requirements and, of course, product features. The model provides a clear assessment of how and when a positive return on investment can be achieved, even with today's technology (in terms of costs and performances).

Unlike traditional supply chains with members competing to reduce their individual costs, the overall cost of the entire supply chain is minimized in a cooperative supply chain. The savings from cooperation may be shared among the members, while a lower average cost and a lower cost variation is materialized for individual members. The problem is formulated as an integrated flow network and expanded to multi-period and multi-product, with the possibility of holding inventories in a multi-stage, multi-member cooperative supply chain. Simulation results indicate an approximately 26% reduction in total costs of the supply chain, utilizing this formulation over competitive setups. In a multiperiod chain, members may hold an inventory or use an inventory policy. As the holding costs increase, the problem decomposes into a single period (just-in-time) again.
