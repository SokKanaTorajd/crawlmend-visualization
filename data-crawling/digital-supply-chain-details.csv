Moreover, the study examines how digital transformation of companies can fuel smart technologies, leading to improved relationship performance. The results of the survey given to 280 Finnish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) show that digital transformation of the companies alone cannot enhance relationship performance, and that it needs to be coupled with smart technologies to achieve this goal. This means that smart technologies fully mediate the relationship between digital transformation and relationship performance."

We collected the data from 256 respondents working in the Indian manufacturing firms to test the theoretical framework. The analysis of data indicates that in terms of institutional pressures, only coercive pressure moderates the relationship of exploration and exploitation orientation to the intentions of adopting Industry 4.0 and digital supply chain. The regulatory bodies and accreditation agencies demand the firms to be part of the digital economy and adopt advance systems to attain the sustainable goals under Industry 4.0 framework and components of digital supply chain. Practicing managers and firms can adopt findings of the study, to follow the adoption of Industry 4.0 in digital supply chain economy."

A Digital Supply Chain (DSC) is a smart, value-driven, efficient process to generate new forms of revenue and business value for organizations and to leverage new approaches with novel technological and analytical methods DSC is not about whether goods and services are digital or physical, it is about the way how supply chain processes are managed with a wide variety of innovative technologies, e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles, cloud computing, and internet of things, among others. Recent literature highlights the importance of DSC and many industrial researchers discuss its applications. This article reviews the state-of-the-art of existing DSC literature in detail from both academic and industrial points of view. It identifies key limitations and prospects in DSC, summarizes prior research and identifies knowledge gaps by providing advantages, weaknesses and limitations of individual methods The article also aims at providing a development framework as a roadmap for future research and practice."

The main novelty of the paper concerns a comparison between static and dynamic solutions of the supply chain game achieved when moving from traditional to digital platforms. Therefore, this study proposes centralized and decentralized versions of the game, comparing their solutions under static and dynamic settings. Moreover, it investigates the decentralized supply chain by evaluating two smart contracts: Revenue sharing and wholesale price contracts. In both cases, the firms use an artificial intelligence system to determine the optimal contract parameters. Numerical and qualitative analyses are used for comparing configurations (centralized, decentralized), settings (static, dynamic), and contract schemes (revenue sharing contract, wholesale price contract). The findings identify the conditions under which smart revenue sharing mechanisms are worth applying."

Though the advantages of digital supply chain management (DSCM) are many, its implementation is quite slow for several reasons. The purpose of this paper is to identify the major barriers which hinder the adoption of DSC and to analyse the interrelationship among them. The barriers of DSC are explored on the basis of existing literature and experts’ opinion. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses the interpretive structural modelling (ISM) approach to develop a hierarchical structural model which shows the mutual dependence among the barriers of DSC. Cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis was performed to represent these barriers graphically on the basis of their driving power and dependence. Findings: The research demonstrates that the barriers “no sense of urgency”, “lack of industry specific guidelines”, “lack of digital skills and talent” and “high implementation and running cost” are the most significant barriers to digital transformation of supply chain. This paper also suggests some managerial implications to overcome the barriers which hinder the implementation of digital transformation of supply chain. Practical implications: This paper assists managers and policymakers to understand the order in which these barriers must be tackled and adopts a roadmap for successful implementation of DSCM and reap its benefits. Originality/value: This is one of the initial research studies which has analysed the barriers of DSC using ISM approach."

As of today, there is a successful experience in the development and subsequent use of various electronic platforms, systems and services, such as SIS of HCS (in the field of housing and communal services), UMIAS (healthcare), Public Services (provision of public services), UIS (procurement), etc. The existence of such software products affects effectively the performance of functions by public authorities, allows optimizing the work, and also provides access to the necessary information. Based on this, we can say that digital technologies cover most areas of the country's life. However, these areas of activity are usually not related to production. This situation is developing not only in Russia, but also in the global economy as a whole. It is easy to implement digital technologies in the service sector. This is largely due to low-cost investments that pay off quickly and make services more affordable. This is not the case with production, where the introduction of digital technologies will require changing the technology or even the organizational mechanism of production functioning. Moreover, it does not depend on which sector of the economy will be affected by the introduction of digital supply chain management (DSCM). The tasks of digital technologies in production should be a significant increase in labor productivity, the use of modern technologies that allow competing in the world market of goods. In addition, digital technologies in the manufacturing sector of the economy are designed to facilitate production management, correct management decisions, and obtaining detailed, necessary information about production processes."

Emerging technologies affect every industry and management of supply chain and logistics are no exception. Given that Digital Supply Chain (DSC) provides several opportunities to companies the topic has received increasing attention from both academia and industry in the recent years. Today, an emerging worldwide trend in supply chain management is a shift of the focus from classical supply chains towards DSC, which leverages new solutions to generate new sources of revenue and additional business value for organizations. Recognizing these potential benefits, today's modern organizations now interact with their dealers through DSC processes for improved efficiency and effectiveness in their production and delivery operations. Supplier selection is one of the crucial processes that has been affected by the digitalization of supply chain management. Addressing multi-criteria nature of the supplier selection process, this article introduces a new DSC approach for the first time to support the supplier selection process. This approach develops a group decision making (GDM) method in an uncertain environment. This methodology also considers decision makers when they are under pressure and/or lack expertise during the evaluation process. The proposed framework integrates for the first time the Interval Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy (IVIF) Sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS) under a GDM environment. IVIF AHP is used to evaluate criteria weights and IVIF ARAS methodology is used for the alternative assessment procedure.

We show that the associations of the deviations from the resilient supply chain performance profile with the risk profiles of supplier performance can be efficiently deciphered by our approach. The results suggest that a combination of supervised machine learning and simulation, if utilized properly, improves the delivery reliability. Our approach can also be of value when analyzing the supplier base and uncovering the critical suppliers, or combinations of suppliers the disruption of which result in the adverse performance decreases. The results of this study advance our understanding about how and when machine learning and simulation can be combined to create digital supply chain twins, and through these twins improve resilience. The proposed data-driven decision-making model for resilient supplier selection can be further exploited for design of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain disruption management models, re-designing the supplier base or investing in most important and risky suppliers."

In the digital video supply chain, it is not clear whether commercialization of the direct distribution channel would be beneficial for the media publisher because it would decrease profits from advertisements. The choice about commercialization should be investigated thoroughly because it is closely related to the media publishers' sustainability as a public medium in a digital environment. In this study, we analyze the impacts of commercializing the direct distribution channel based on a game-theoretic approach. Specifically, we compare the profits of a media publisher with and without the commercialization of the channel from analyses of sequentially defined games.

This need for constructing digital twins is caused by the low reliability and stability of supply chains due to the faults in their operation. These faults are a result of risks in the supply chains which can be consolidated into two types. The first type is operational risks. These are the current risks of the supply chain itself caused by an uncertainty of supply and demand as well as by an obstructed flow of information along the supply chain. The second type is critical risks caused by force majeure. These risks disrupt the normal operation of the supply chain and critically reduce the most important performance indicators of the company such as annual income and profits. Risks happen due to natural or man-made causes such as fires and floods in the distribution centers or at production facilities, legal disputes with suppliers, strikes, terrorist attacks on logistics facilities and others. Dynamic simulation and analytical optimization are two dominant technologies for managing risks of the supply chains, which helps to increase their reliability and stability if failures occur. Through optimizing and simulating of the supply chains, companies can generate new infor-mation about the impact of failure and influence the supply chain and its performance by looking at various scenarios that simulate the locations of failures, the duration and recovery policies.

However, the selection of a suitable partner is not an easygoing process and is mostly associated with complexity. Various criteria are considered during the partner evaluation process.

They can form the basis for building digital supply chains (networks) that are a new stage in their evolution. The article explains the concept of digital innovation and highlights the place of technology in supply chain management. The goal of the article is to present the results of research carried out using the CATI method among supply chain managers using digital technologies. The most important changes resulting from the application of these technologies include not only the increase in the level of process automation, but also the extension of distribution with a new sales channel, as well as the possibility of simultaneous communication with several partners and access to information related to logistics activities, i.e. free space in warehouses and planned freight routes. Such effects give the potential to improve the competitive position and constitute a premise for the further development of the digital transformation of supply chains. In this process, however, not only are the costs of the implemented technologies important (indicated as the main barrier to their implementation), but also the competences enabling the identification of digital innovations that best respond to the needs of supply chain management.

Thanks to the rise of technology, supply chain is also becoming more visible. It has allowed for data transparency to expand and thus, affecting the way organizations have the ability to gain visibility on real-time issues about their supply chain networks. This combination has made it possible for supply chain to become more powerful and accessible. The changes in demands and economy along with the rise of technology has made all the difference. This expansion is driving change for faster results and flow, thus the rise of digitalization has become a major contributor of the supply chain market. Based on the available data, we can say that the main share of digital technologies in the developed world is used in the supply chain sector. However, over the past 10 years, digital technologies have also begun to be used in strategically important sectors of the economy, such as the production, processing and sale of products. Moreover, the level of digitalization of some technological supply chain processes reaches 80% or higher. In Russian practice, there are a number of legal acts that promote the development of digital technologies in the real sector of the economy. In addition, the directions and even measures of state support are outlined. This article describes the authors' vision of the state of digitalization in the agro-industrial complex of Russia, the problems that exist, areas of improvement, risks and threats that authorities and commercial organizations will face when implementing digital technologies. Based on world practice, the study provides data indicating the positive role of digital technologies: increasing the profitability of production, saving costs, increasing production indicators. The study shows the main breakthrough technological platforms on which the development of digital technologies in agricultural production will be based."

In detail, first, the authors identify the subset of enabling technologies pertaining to the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) that can be considered the most relevant for effective SCM-M integration (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things, Cloud computing, Big Data analytics and customer profiling, Cyber security). Second, the authors carry out a patent analysis aimed at providing a comprehensive overview of the patenting activity trends characterizing the set of digital technologies under investigation, hence highlighting their innovation dynamics and applications. Findings: This research provides insightful information about which digital technologies may enable the SCM-M integration. Specifically, the authors highlight the role those solutions play in terms of information acquisition, storage and elaboration for SCM-M integration by relying on illustrative actual examples. Moreover, the authors present the organisations more involved in the development of digital technologies for SCM-M integration over time and offer an examination of their technological impact in terms of influence on subsequent technological developments. Originality/value: So far, much has been said about why marketing and supply chain management functions should be integrated. However, a clear picture of the digital technologies that might be adopted to achieve this objective has yet to be revealed.

By simulating the model numerically, we observe the chaotic behaviours of the model. We find that the system has chaotic behaviours over a wide range of the values of the system parameters.

The traditional process to produce a custom-made foot orthotic device is to use manual casting of foot shape and physical moulding of orthoses materials. Parts of this process can be undertaken using digital tools rather than manual processes with potential advantages. The aim of this trial was to provide the first comparison of a traditional orthoses supply chain to a digital supply chain over a 6 month period. The trial used plantar pressure, health status, and health service time and cost data to compare the two supply chains. Methods: Fifty-seven participants with diabetes were randomly allocated to each supply chain. Plantar pressure data and health status (EQ5D, ICECAP) was assessed at point of supply and at six-months. The costs for orthoses and clinical services accessed by participants were assessed over the 6 months of the trial. Primary outcomes were: reduction in peak plantar pressure at the site of highest pressure, assessed for non-inferiority to current care. Secondary outcomes were: reduction in plantar pressure at foot regions identified as at risk (> 200 kPa), cost-consequence analysis (supply chain, clinician time, service use) and health status. Results: At point of supply pressure reduction for the digital supply chain was non-inferior to a predefined margin and superior (p < 0.1) to the traditional supply chain, but both supply chains were inferior to the margin after 6 months. Custom-made orthoses significantly reduced pressure for at risk regions compared to a flat control (traditional - 13.85%, digital - 20.52%). The digital supply chain was more expensive (+£13.17) and required more clinician time (+ 35 min). There were no significant differences in health status or service use between supply chains. Conclusions: Custom made foot orthoses reduce pressure as expected. Given some assumptions about the cost models we used, the supply chain process adopted to produce the orthoses seems to have marginal impact on overall costs and health status."

This paper presents a novel distribution model of digital products inspired by lean supply chain principles called CloudChain, which has been designed to support the information management during digital product lifecycle. This model enables connected networks of customers, partners and organizations to conduct the stages of digital product lifecycle as value chains. Virtual distribution channels are created over cloud resources for applications of organizations to deliver digital products to applications of partners through a seamless information flow. A configurable packing and logistic service was developed to ensure confidentiality and privacy in the product delivery by using encrypted packs. A chain management architecture enables organizations to keep tighter control over their value chains, distribution channels and digital products.

Design/methodology/approach: An online search was performed to locate training that is available for supply chain employees. Training providers who met the online delivery criterion were identified and evaluated on: (1) amount of supply chain content and/or digital technology content, (2) flexibility, (3) customizable and (4) credentials offered. Findings: Several sources of supply chain training were identified—supply chain professional organizations, consultants, MOOC courses and MicroMasters programs at colleges and universities. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study are limited by the fact that the number of supply chain training providers identified is not exhaustive and because the study examined training opportunities available at a particular point in time. Course offerings will change over time; certification requirements will be updated, and new providers will appear. Practical implications: By identifying sources of supply chain training that are currently available to help bridge this serious skill shortage, the results can serve as a guide to enterprises moving toward supply chain digitalization. Social implications: To succeed in the current environment of digital transformation, employees need opportunities to build digital skills that are demanded by corporations around the world.

The study theorizes how the risk-mitigating effect of system modularity can be enhanced by the allocation of decision rights to the IT (information technology) unit. The main logic is that IT managers with more domain IT knowledge can better utilize their knowledge in decision making to achieve effective system modularity. We tested these theoretical propositions using a survey study of Chinese companies and found empirical support. We also found that the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit does not directly mitigate the perceived risk of digital supply chain systems, which highlights the role of decision allocation to the IT unit as a key moderator in risk mitigation.

This has resulted in the establishment of information systems such as e-supply chains (eSCs) amongst others which integrate the internet and other information and communications technology (ICT) with traditional business processes for the swift transmission of information between trading partners. Many organisations have reaped the benefits that come from adopting the eSC model, but have also faced the challenges with which it comes. One such major challenge is information security. With the current state of cybercrime, system developers are challenged with the task of developing cutting edge digital forensic readiness (DFR) systems that can keep up with current technological advancements, such as (eSCs). Hence, the problem addressed in this paper is the lack of a well-formulated DFR approach that can assist system developers in the development of e-supply chain digital forensic readiness systems. The main objective of such a system being that it must be able to provide law enforcement/digital forensic investigators (DFI) with forensically sound and readily available potential digital evidence that can expedite and support digital forensics incident response processes. This approach, if implemented can also prepare trading partners for security incidents that might take place, if not prevent them from occurring. Therefore, the work presented in this paper is aimed at providing a procedural approach that is based on digital forensics principles. This paper discusses the limitations of current system monitoring tools in relation to the kind of specialised DFR systems that are needed in the eSC environment and proposes an eSC-DFR process model and architectural design model that can lead to the development of next-generation eSC DFR systems. It is the view of the authors that the conclusions drawn from this paper can spearhead the development of cutting-edge next-generation digital forensic readiness systems, and bring attention to some of the shortcomings of current system monitoring tools."

This study proposes a cyber physical logistics system (CPLS) that is coordinated with the agent cyber physical production systems in a multi-level CPS structure. This multi-level architectural framework is designed to provide technical functionalities for resilient SC control. The service composition procedures of technical functionalities on the distributed digital twin (DT) simulation are divided into type and instance stages. The operation procedures of the DT application and technical functionality of the DT engine are suggested. The proposed CPLS has appropriate service composition and operation for the bullwhip and ripple effects, which are the two main SC-related problems.

In the second phase, through a qualitative study, the results of the first phase are discussed with the industry experts to seek their expert opinion. In doing so, the semi-structured interview from seven experts, selected through purposive sampling, were conducted. The findings of both inquiries reveal that blockchain technology has significant potential to enhance the integration between numerous actors in multi-level supply chains while ensuring the transparency and traceability in the transactions. Moreover, the findings reveal that certain pre-requisites are missing at the moment in the Malaysian manufacturing sector, which are inevitable to be met, before implementing the block-chain based supply chain. Sophisticated infrastructure which could suffice the blockchain-based technologies implementation in supply chains and the absorptive capacity is prominent amongst them. Consequently, it is recommended that appropriate training should be given to employees in order to cater to the requirement of the technical skills needed to handle such advanced technology. Further, continuous infrastructural investments should be made to implement blockchain-based technology in the business ecosystem of Malaysia at the government level."

Consumers' piracy risk cost is divided into two cases: 1) linear piracy cost and 2) fixed piracy cost. We also analyze two contract types: 1) fixed fee contract and 2) per song contract. Our findings indicate that the magnitude of profit loss depends on the type of consumers' piracy risk cost and the type of contract. In addition, changes in consumers' piracy risk cost change the distribution of the profit between the record label and the retailer. As the investment in piracy controls increases, the retailer keeps a larger share of the profit surplus leaving the record label with a smaller share. We demonstrate that a fixed fee full transfer contract will always coordinate the supply chain, and the profitability further increases as 1) market size increases, 2) piracy risk cost increases, and 3) marginal cost decreases. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Case overview/synopsis: Al-Rumman Pharma is headquartered in Dubai, is an integrated international pharmaceutical company providing a wide range of pharmaceutical solutions to manufacture high quality and affordable generic medicines. It holds credibility amongst healthcare professionals and patients, across the Middle East and North African (MENA) markets. Their quality assurance is fostered by high levels of reliability and order fulfillment, which differentiates them from their competitors. Recently, they have been facing technology fatigue meant as an organization suffering from overwhelming options and choices in technology, this contributes to turbulent and confused states of mind when considering technology adaptation. This case evolves specifically from a procurement perspective, the pressure of high expectation and severe compliance clauses from key suppliers, particularly large corporations with monopolies in supplies who have the tendency to dominate and dictate terms to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs). For example, forcing SME’s to adopt specific technological frameworks to be trade partners. Another conflict is that while the SME’s do value the contribution of the procurement function, the shift from tactical to strategic mindset is not robust enough. Is this a dilemma? Ms Mary buyer at Al-Rumman Pharma, which is SME in operation, is facing challenges from key suppliers because of her tactical buying approach and adoption of multiple technological frameworks from various key suppliers, which are neither integrated nor compatible with each other. Her transition from traditional buying to a more strategic sourcing approach is what the need of the hour is. Prior information technology role was more as support at Al-Rumman Pharma and Chief Executive Officer Dr Mubeen Ahmad Khan did technology adopted decisions in isolation but today the company needs an integrative approach with forward thinking and also kept the legacy intact. Resistance to change was very inevitable once it was integrated. Complexity academic level: This case has been particularly focused on undergraduates in the final semester of management courses, as well as masters level students specializing in supply chain and operation management courses. It is also for practitioner procurement and supply chain managers going for various supply chain management related certification courses. Students who have studied procurement management are most suitable to accomplish this case study. Executives pursuing a business program are also recommended to study this case.

Sensor technologies can collect relevant data in forest-based supply chains, comprising all activities from within forests and the production of the woody raw material to its transformation into marketable forest-based products. Advanced planning systems can help to support decisions of the various entities in the supply chain, e.g., forest owners, harvest companies, haulage companies, and forest product processing industry. Such tools can help to deal with the complex interdependencies between different entities, often with opposing objectives and actions—which may increase efficiency of forest-based supply chains.

Higher sustainability and efficiency of forest-based supply chains require a seamless information flow to foster integrated planning of the activities over the supply chain—thereby facilitating seamless data exchange between the supply chain entities and foster new forms of collaboration. Therefore, this paper deals with data exchange and multi-entity collaboration aspects in combination with interoperability challenges related with the integration among multiple process data collection tools and advanced planning systems.

"" Digital technology has radically altered almost every business. On the one hand, companies now provide untold numbers of products and services with digital capabilities or components. Smart phones and SaaS (software as a service) are two good examples. On the other hand, digital technology has changed how many businesses design, source, make, move, store and service products. Consider 3-D printing, which lets companies produce parts locally using a digital template, thereby creating easily customizable goods that can be moved to market quickly. Another illustration is advanced visibility and analytics, which make it possible for businesses to sense changes more quickly and analyze data more thoroughly, thus creating new revenue opportunities. Most companies understand how elemental these changes are. And many are working to introduce new digital capabilities into their operations. But even companies that embrace these challenges often overlook the difference between traditional supply chains that have been "" digitally enhanced "" and truly integrated, re-invented supply chains whose DNA is fundamentally digital. Most organizations, in fact, are doing the former: They're welding digital capabilities onto traditional supply chains, thus creating hybrid models that combine older paper-based and newer IT-optimized processes.

Nevertheless, in the past years, the attention of researchers and practitioners moved to the application of the Blockchain technologies to other domains. Recently, it represents the backbone of a new digital supply chain. Thanks to its capability of ensuring data immutability and public accessibility of data streams, Blockchain can increase the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of the overall supply chain, and optimize the inbound processes. The literature concerning Blockchain in non-financial applications mainly focused on the technological part and the Business Process Modeling, lacking in terms of standard methodology for designing a strategy to develop and validate the overall Blockchain solution and integrate it in the Business Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to overcome this lack. First, we integrate the current literature filling the lack concerning the digital strategy, creating a standard methodology to design Blockchain technology use cases, which are not related to finance applications. Second, we present the results of a use case in the fresh food delivery, showing the critical aspects of implementing a Blockchain solution. Moreover, the paper discusses how the Blockchain will help in reducing the logistics costs and in optimizing the operations and the research challenges."

As digitally enabled manufacturing machines continue to grow exponentially, it becomes imperative to uniquely and securely identify them in the cyber-physical world, particularly in defense, biomedical, energy and aerospace manufacturing. Research about threats originating from internal adversaries’ i.e the machine/organization owner within a tiered digitally connected supply chain is scarce. This paper introduces a machine fingerprinting scheme named as the ‘Witness Box Protocol’ (WBP) that exploits the physical properties of manufacturing machines (legacy or smart) and their surroundings to create a unique biometric like fingerprint. WBP provides both machine registration and authentication on a digital network through a low cost, non-invasive approach. The fingerprint is generated by a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique that accommodates small variations in physical signature data and can corroborate data provenance from machines by verifying machine identity through authentication. Additionally, this fingerprint hash simplifies asset management within a large enterprise or distributed network comprising of thousands of machines in a Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) paradigm. In this research, fingerprints were randomly generated from the statistical features of signals from 3D printers and CNC machine in a production-like lab environment. Using k-means clustering and Jaccard similarity index, these fingerprints are shown to identify the source equipment with 95 % accuracy."

Dematerialization of physical products is transforming the way firms are positioned in the supply chain due to a reduction in production and transport costs and the different ways business engage with customers. Specifically, we propose that these new market conditions can empower downstream firms. We further propose that upstream firms can still capture additional value through digital service if their servitized offer includes difficult to imitate elements. The context of the analysis is the publishing industry. The Payment Card method employed is used to test UK and US consumer's perceptions of digital formats (eBooks) and assess their willingness to pay in relation to printed formats. The method undertaken enables us to elicit aggregated consumer demand for eBooks which in turn identifies optimal pricing strategies for the digital services. Analysis demonstrates that during digital servitization upstream firms should seek to deploy unique resources to ensure their strategic position in the supply chain is not diminished."

Providers compete both for business and final customers, while cooperating the exchanges of information flows composing the digital commodities, to provide a complete, end to end, service to final users. A myriad of interconnection decisions form the connectivity's architecture of this Global Supply Chain Network, designing the rules of the business game played by the operators. This paper, using a dataset of interconnection protocols over 195 Internet Exchange Points across the World, focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and clustering: the mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship between connectivity and clustering is clear: the better connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver the digital commodities with high quality and low costs and, when the neighbours of a provider are less interconnected among themselves, it is easier, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. We estimate an econometric model finding that the continental location of an Internet Exchange Point has a significant effect on the sign of the elasticity between clustering and connectivity. This indicates that Local Supply Chain Networks display significant differences in their clusters of integration, hierarchical organization and complexity, depending on whether they are based in Europe, North America or Rest of the World. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

This paper focuses on improving the application level of DTs in the supply chain through coordination for enhancing the performance. We consider a supply chain with one-supplier-one-retailer and coordinate it with the cost-sharing contract and revenue-cost-sharing contract (the improved contract). We find out that the retailer and supplier did not always have the willingness to use DTs to alleviate the BWE. Even if they have the intention to use DTs, their ideal application level is not the same. After coordination, both the application level of DTs and the performance of the supply chain are improved, and we find that the improved contract has a better coordination effect.

The review offers a structured approach to what is currently a disparate and fractured field in logistics. Design/methodology/approach: The systematic literature review examines the interface between e-commerce and LML. Following a protocol-driven methodology, combined with a “snowballing” technique, a total of 47 articles form the basis of the review. Findings: The literature analysis conceptualises the relationship between a broad set of contingency variables and operational characteristics of LML configuration (push-centric, pull-centric, and hybrid system) via a set of structural variables, which are captured in the form of a design framework. The authors propose four future research areas reflecting likely digital supply chain evolutions. Research limitations/implications: To circumvent subjective selection of articles for inclusion, all papers were assessed independently by two researchers and counterchecked with two independent logistics experts. Resulting classifications inform the development of future LML models. Practical implications: The design framework of this study provides practitioners insights on key contingency and structural variables and their interrelationships, as well as viable configuration options within given boundary conditions. The reformulated knowledge allows these prescriptive models to inform practitioners in their design of last-mile distribution. Social implications: Improved LML performance would have positive societal impacts in terms of service and resource efficiency. Originality/value: This paper provides the first comprehensive review on LML models in the modern e-commerce context. It synthesises knowledge of LML models and provides insights on current trends and future research directions."

The first impact was printing plate manufacturers withdrawn from the supply chain; further, the e-commerce techniques improved the logistic system and customer relationship management. Technology did accelerate the effectiveness of the supply chain, but did not change too much the sequences and supply-demand relationships between members in it. For instance, with the publishing products become “virtualized,” the roles of authors, publishers, distributors, resellers, and customers are transforming as a contingent system. A reader can easily perform as an author, and publisher via online bookstores, even blogs or facebook. Therefore, the roles in the publishing supply chain as well as their future practices in producing digital content are the main purposes of this study.Since the past few years, due to the proliferation of sophisticated publishing technologies, the threshold of publishing has been lowered. Everyone has a chance to self-publish his/her own work and become an author. These authors come into contact with their audiences directly, sell books, and become best-selling writers. However, as the new types of publishing are developing, the sales of physical paper books are declining. It causes the supply-demand imbalance in the publishing market. In order to cope with this new publishing wave, how the structure of the publishing supply chain will change? how the suppliers will reposition their roles?

This study is carried out through a literature review and empirical findings from a series of interviews, and an explorative survey. The literature review identified a substantial difference in compatibility between industry level and the digital transformation Supply Chain 4.0 implies. Empirical findings showed that among the investigated trends, 3D printing was considered to have a major impact on Supply Chain 4.0. Its use though has been limited due to uncertainty among the supply chain stakeholders about its true added value in a cost/benefit perspective. Moreover, multinationals showed a strong preference for Big Data implementations, but only had limited focus on cloud computing applications. This paper presents a graphical framework meant to give practitioners a better description and understanding of the issues that have been debated concerning Supply Chain 4.0, their adaptability and their strengths and challenges."

The platform with operational data of each retail store can effectively help retailers select marketable products and then improve their operational efficiency. We first investigate the motivation of retailers in accepting the platform digital empowerment (PDE) and joining the platform. We find that the retailer should join the platform and choose PDE only when the sales effort cost coefficient is high and the effect of sales effort on demand is weak. Second, we investigate the influence of the number of retailers on the platform network effect and find that the more retailers on the platform, the more profits the retailers and the e-commerce platform will make. Besides, the retailers’ sales efforts and the PDE level will increase. Third, we study the PDE decisions under the unconstrained and decentralized control system (DC), the decentralized control system with revenue sharing contract (RS) and the decentralized control system with profit sharing contract (PS), respectively. We find that the platform's profit in PS is the highest among these systems if the sales effort cost coefficient is high. Furthermore, for these systems, the PDE level under DC is always the highest if the effort cost is low; otherwise, the PDE level under PS is the highest. In addition, the sales effort under DC is always the highest if PDE is employed, that is, nether RS nor PS can effectively promote the retailer's sales effort."

This paper presents a novel distribution model of digital products inspired by lean supply chain principles called CloudChain, which has been designed to support the information management during digital product lifecycle. This model enables connected networks of customers, partners and organizations to conduct the stages of digital product lifecycle as value chains. Virtual distribution channels are created over cloud resources for applications of organizations to deliver digital products to applications of partners through a seamless information flow. A configurable packing and logistic service was developed to ensure confidentiality and privacy in the product delivery by using encrypted packs. A chain management architecture enables organizations to keep tighter control over their value chains, distribution channels and digital products. CloudChain software instances were integrated to an information management system of a space agency. In an experimental evaluation CloudChain prototype was evaluated in a private cloud where the feasibility of applying supply chain principles to the delivery of digital products in terms of efficiency, flexibility and security was revealed."

These methods offer the freedom of complexity to the designers and choices of localized and pull-based production system to the managers. These propositions of AM have been enabling custom manufacturing and are catalysts for rapid growth of additive manufacturing (AM). This paper analyzes the general characteristics of AM supply chain and proposes three AM supply chain models based on the specific nature of the industry. Our description of the models emphasizes on adopting an holistic view of the AM supply chain and therefore includes raw material, printer hardware and the virtual supply chain. Throughout the product life cycle of additively manufactured products, the interlacing of the virtual supply chain (digital thread) with the physical supply chain and their operations fundamentally make the AM process a cyber-physical system (CPS). Therefore, the technology brings along with it benefits of a CPS as well as a new class of attack vectors. We discuss the possible attacks (printer, raw material and design level), risks (reverse engineering, counterfeiting and theft) and provide an enhanced risk classification scheme. We contend that the traditional cybersecurity methods need to evolve to address the new class of attack vectors that threaten the AM supply chain and also discuss the nature of existing solutions that help in addressing the risks and attack threats. In providing an holistic view of the AM supply chain the interdependencies of the processes in the AM supply chain are presented and we elucidate the effects of local attack vectors on the entire supply chain. Further, we discuss the existing security measures to mitigate the risk and identify the existing gap in AM security that needs to be bridged."

Using a structured online survey questionnaire, the data were collected from Finnish e-commerce companies, which had supplied an e-shop, and they were asked to evaluate the purchasing process of the shop as an example of an e-commerce project. The results suggest that one of the dimensions of e-commerce characteristics (service delivery characteristics) positively contributes to the supplier relationship value, whereas the other two dimensions (product characteristics and buyer operations) do not.

While switching to DSCs, the decision-making becomes more complex with an upsurge in the size of the manufacturing firms. The manufacturing firms need to develop supply chain quality management (SCQM) systems to improvise their processes for delivering advance products and services. For developing SCQM, the role of the digital supplier is significant, as they may recuperate the quality management systems (QMS) for enhancing the firm's performance. The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that affect the selection of digital suppliers. The other purpose is to evaluate the alternatives for identifying the best supplier that enhances the QMS for DSCs. Design/methodology/approach: The decision-making is complex for digital supplier selection (DSS) and thus, the study has utilized integrated SWARA-WASPAS methods for their critical evaluation. The stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method has been utilized for identifying the weightage of factors and weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) for assessing the digital suppliers to explore the best alternative. The integrated SWARA-WASPAS method is the most advance approach in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) for the evaluation of the factors. Findings: The study reveals that supplier competency is the most significant factor in selecting digital supplier in DSC that may improve the product and service quality. The study also explores that manufacturing firms needs an efficient system for developing value for the internal and external partners that help them to cope up with the dynamic world. On the basis of the WASPAS results, supplier S8 has been ranked as the best supplier who has highest competency in the form of responsiveness, resilience, sustainable practices and digital innovation. Research limitations/implications: The factors are assessed on the decision team of experts that may be biased and thus, the research may further be validated through empirical studies. The research has to be extended in other nations for exploring how organizations and customers are responding to the DSCs. Practical implications: The study has given insights to the manufacturing firms to consider the crucial factors for DSS, as it affects the overall performance of the organizations. The decision makers of manufacturing organizations should consider the factors such as supplier competency, digital innovation and information sharing for value creation that may provide them better opportunities for developing their DSCs along with their digital suppliers to connect with stakeholders appropriately. Social implications: The improved SCQM aligned with DSS will offer quality products that are sustainable and provide social and economic benefits to the society. The DSS will be able to provide improvisation of the existing products and services for developing a sustainable value chains for the manufacturing organizations. This process will bring more transparency, viability and sustainability in the product and services. As a result, the DSC partners will be more transparent, viable and resilient. Originality/value: The research on DSS and its importance in enhancing QMS is limited. This research is the novel approach to understand the criteria behind the selection of the digital suppliers’ role and their presence in enhancing the quality of products and services."

Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management."

Similarly, the paper aims to recognize and understand, from a value-creation perspective, the correlation between DD and BD generation and between DD and SCM. Design/methodology/approach: The approach utilized in the present study consists of two steps: first, a systematic literature review was conducted aiming at finding out to determine the existing relationship between “Big Data Analytics” (BDA), “SCM” and the “DD”. A total of 595 articles were considered, and analysis showed a clear relationship among BDA, SCM, and DD. Next, the Vector autoregressive (VAR) approach was applied in a case study to prove the correlation between DD (as part of internet usage) and internet acquisitions, and in general terms the relationship between DD and Trade. Internet usage and internet acquisition in imports and exports at the European level were considered as variables in an empirical study of European trade. The novelty of this two-tiered approach consists in its application of a systematic literature review, the first of its kind, to generate inputs for the longitudinal case study of imports and exports at the EU level. In turn, the case study tested the accuracy of the theorized relationship among the main variables. Findings: By analyzing the connection between DD and internet acquisitions, a positive and long-lasting impulse response function was revealed, followed by an ascending trend. This suggests that a self-multiplying effect is being generated, and it is reasonable to assume that the more individuals use the internet, the more electronic acquisitions occur. We can thus reasonably conclude that the improvement of the BD and SCM process is strongly dependent on the quality of the human factor. Tackling DA is the new reading key in the decision-making process: quantifying the added value of the human factor in SCM is challenging and is an ongoing process, based on the opportunity cost between automation in decision-making or relying on the complexity of human factors. Research limitations/implications: One of the biggest limits in our research is the lack of the time series available on consumer orientations and preferences. Data on the typology of customer preferences, and how they are shaped, modified, or altered, were non-accessible, though big companies may have access to this data. The present longitudinal study on European trade helps clarify how and to what extent BDA, SCM, and DD are inter-related. The modeling of the theoretical framework likewise highlights several identifiable benefits for companies of adopting BDA in their business processes. Practical implications: Understanding the obstacles to DD in trade companies and states, and identifying their influence on firm performance, serves to orient the decision-making process in SCM toward reducing DD to generate important economic benefits. Enhancing internet usage may accelerate longer-term investments in human resources, offering developing countries unprecedented opportunities to enhance their educational systems and to improve their economic policies, widening the range of opportunities for businesses and poor states. Social implications: BD generation will undeniably influence microeconomic decisions: they will become evaluation tools of more efficient economic progress in small and/or large economies. However, an economically efficient society will be achievable only in those countries in which qualified human resources can generate and manage BD, to unlock its potential. This twofold effect will surely affect the socio-economic and geopolitical situation. The economic progress of conventional countries may vacillate if it is not adequately flanked by qualified human resources able to progress the information and communication technology (ICT) prevalent in contemporary economies. Consequently, the social impact of investments in ICT capacity building will necessarily affect future socio-economic scenarios. New indicators will become necessary to measure the conventional progress, and one of them will surely be DD. Originality/value: The novelty of the present study is twofold: first, it is the first meticulous meta-analysis developed using a very wide analysis of the published literature to highlight a previously hidden relationship among DD, BD, and SCM. This comparative approach made it possible to build a theoretical framework for the real evaluation of the impact of BDA on different organizational elements, including SCM. Second, the research emphasizes the need to reform and reshape the studies on BDA, convincing companies that it is necessary to understand that the obstacles (DD and DA, i.e. internet usage) must be addressed with conscious decision-making processes, strategically and resolutely, to transform points of weakness into opportunities."

This paper aims to both bridge the gap between the practitioner and academic literature on these topics and contribute to both practice and theory by seeking to understand how such developments will help to address key supply chain challenges and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach: A multi-disciplinary, systematic literature review was conducted on relevant concepts and capabilities. A total of 126 articles were reviewed covering the time period 1950-2018. Findings: The results show that both IoT and AI are the technologies most frequently associated with the anticipated autonomous and predictive capabilities of future supply chains. In addition, the review highlights a lacuna in how such technologies and capabilities help address key supply chain challenges and opportunities. A new supply chain model is, thus, proposed, one with autonomous and predictive capabilities: the self-thinking supply chain. Originality/value: It is our hope that this novel concept, presented here for the first time in the academic literature, will help both practitioners to craft appropriate future-proofed supply chain strategies and provide the research community with a model (built upon multidisciplinary insights) for elucidating the application of new digital technologies in the supply chain of the future.

Large companies are of great significance in this process; agricultural holdings are very important in Russian agricultural business. Unfortunately, the Russian agribusiness sector is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises, namely, concurrent enterprises, farms, small businesses in rural areas. They produce and market agricultural products. Therefore, supply chain management in agricultural business requires digitalization and the use of flexible management methods. The purpose of the research is to study agile supply chain management methods in agricultural business. We have considered such flexible methods as a digital platform and a blockchain technology, which contribute to the partnership between small and medium-sized agrifood enterprises by creating a digital network platform for all parties interested in the agricultural product. These methods are more productive compared to the traditional approaches; they provide more efficient interaction between manufacturers, consumers and intermediaries in the flow of goods and services through the supply chain. Unfortunately, agile supply chain management in the agricultural business of Russia has not been widely introduced yet, which makes it difficult to collect analytical information. We believe that this may be explained by the predominance of small and medium-sized enterprises in the country, the lack of digital platforms that act as intermediaries in the supply chain to connect crop producers and consumers."

The resulting opacity poses a significant barrier to the measurement and minimization of energy consumption and therefore to the implementation of sustainable manufacturing. The current article investigates whether the adoption of additive manufacturing (AM) technology can be used to reach transparency in terms of energy and financial inputs to manufacturing operations. AM refers to the use of a group of electricity-driven technologies capable of combining materials to manufacture geometrically complex products in a single digitally controlled process step, entirely without molds, dies, or other tooling. The single-step nature affords full measurability with respect to process energy inputs and production costs. However, the parallel character of AM (allowing the contemporaneous production of multiple parts) poses previously unconsidered problems in the estimation of manufacturing resource consumption. This research discusses the implementation of a tool for the estimation of process energy flows and costs occurring in the AM technology variant direct metal laser sintering. It is demonstrated that accurate predictions can be made for the production of a basket of sample parts. Further, it is shown that, unlike conventional processes, the quantity and variety of parts demanded and the resulting ability to fully utilize the available machine capacity have an impact on process efficiency. It is also demonstrated that cost minimization in additive manufacturing may lead to the minimization of process energy consumption, thereby motivating sustainability improvements. © 2012 by Yale University."

However, secondary post-processing using traditional processes such as machining, grinding, heat treatment and hot isostatic pressing, i.e., Hybrid Manufacturing, is required to achieve Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), surface finish and desired mechanical properties. It is often challenging for most traditional manufacturers to participate in the rapidly evolving supply chain of direct digital manufacturing (DDM) through in-house investments in cost prohibitive metal AM. This research investigates a system of strategically-located AM hubs which can integrate hybrid-AM with the capabilities and excess capacity in multiple traditional manufacturing facilities. Using North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) data for machine shops in the U.S., an uncapacitated facility location model is used to determine the optimal locations for AM hub centers based on: (1) geographical data, (2) demand and (3) cost of hybrid-AM processing. Results from this study have identified: (a) candidate US counties to build AM hubs, (b) total cost (fixed, operational and transportation) and (c) capacity utilization of the AM hubs. It was found that uncapacitated facility location models identified demand centroid as the optimal location and was affected only by AM utilization rate whereas a constrained p-median model identified 22 AM hub locations as the initial sites for AM hubs which grows to 44 AM hubs as demand increases. It was also found that transportation cost was not a significant factor in the hybrid-AM supply chain. Findings from this study will help both AM companies and traditional manufacturers to determine location in the U.S and key factors to advance the metal hybrid-AM supply chain."

It allows firms to achieve different levels of substantial benefits and strategic advantages such as cost reduction, service improvement, faster reaction time and efficient adaptation to changing business environment (Tsou 2013). However, collaboration success, by large, depends on the level of partners' engagement and commitment (Thomas and Baird 1990). Additionally, differences in power, financial reasons, goal compatibility or disagreements in use of IT resources also pose challenges to SCC especially when a large and intricate network of actors, stages and locations are involved (Ralston et al. 2017). Other problems include lack of efficiency (inaccuracies, billing disputes, outright fraud and corruption), inconsistent inventory management and barriers to cross-border payments and expensive impartial third-party auditing. These challenges calls into question the transparency and trust among actors. These challenges also give rise to the problems of counterfeiting, forced labor and poor conditions in factories (Dickinson 2016). However, it seems evident that our understanding of blockchain use-case in SCC is not aligned with what the industry demands. This study will explore the literature to identify the key success factors for ensuring optimum supply chain collaboration via blockchain integration through the lenses of digital governance and business model innovation frameworks.

Waste recovery is dependent on the creation of connections along the supply chain, so that actors with goods at risk of becoming waste can transfer them to those who may be able to use them as inputs or for their own consumption. Such waste recovery is, however, often hampered by what we call ‘circularity holes’, i.e., missing linkages between waste generators and potential receivers. A new type of actor, the digital platform organization, has recently taken on a brokerage function to bridge circularity holes, particularly in the food supply chain. Yet, extant literature has overlooked this novel type of brokerage that exploits digital technology for the transfer and recovery of discarded resources between supply chain actors. Our study investigates this actor, conceptualized as a ‘circularity broker’, and thus unites network research and circular supply chain research. Focusing on the food supply chain, we adopt an interpretive inductive theory-building approach to uncover how platform organizations foster the recovery of waste by bridging circularity holes. We identify and explicate six brokerage roles, i.e., connecting, informing, protecting, mobilizing, integrating and measuring, and discuss them in relation to extant literature, highlighting novelties compared to earlier studies.

Digital supply chain brings down those walls and the chain becomes a completely connected that is transparent to all the actors involved from the shippers of goods, delivery service companies, and finally to the customers. Logistics as part of the supply chain has an important role in Indonesia. Specifically, in delivery services. Currently, the tracking of the delivery service company can only be executed from one drop point to another drop point. A trip between drop points cannot be traced so that the tracking becomes not transparent. Logistics roles in delivery service company should utilize the Internet of Things (IoT) in handling customer who needs real-time transparency routes and monitoring of temperature-sensitive pharmaceutical cargo and perishable cargo. If this is implemented, delivery service companies in Indonesia can be crowned as the most advanced delivery service company in the world. The research information system uses a quantitative method. The data collection technique used in this research was collected by filling out a questionnaire. The result shown indicates that delivery service companies in Indonesia may use Traceable e-Seal that are connected to the MyTraceable application as a solution to transparency route, real-time monitoring of temperature-sensitive goods.

Internet of things (IoT) comes with a solution to manage a complex, scalable supply chain system, but to provide and attain enough security during information exchange, along with keeping the privacy of its users, is the great inherent challenge of IoT. To fulfill these limitations, this study designs and models a scaled IoT-based supply chain (IoT-SC) system, comprising several operations and participants, and deploys mechanisms to leverage the security, mainly confidentially, integrity, authentication (CIA), and a digital signature scheme to leverage potentially secured non-repudiation security service for the worst-case scenario, and to leverage privacy to keep users sensitive personal and location information protected against adversarial entities to the IoT-SC system. Indeed, a scaled IoT-SC system certainly opens new challenges to manage privacy and security while communicating. Therefore, in the IoT-SC system, each transaction writes from edge computing nodes to the IoT-SC controller is thoroughly examined to ensure the proposed solutions in bi-directional communication, and their robustness against adversarial behaviors. Future research works, employing blockchain and its integrations, are detailed as paces to accelerate the privacy and security of the IoT-SC system, for example, migrating IoT-centric computing to an immutable, decentralized platform."

The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

The study also theorizes how the risk-mitigating effect of system modularity can be enhanced by the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit. The main logic is that IT managers with more domain IT knowledge can better utilize their knowledge in decision making to achieve effective system modularity. We tested these theoretical propositions using a survey study of Chinese companies and found empirical support. We also found that the allocation of decision rights to the IT unit does not directly mitigate the perceived risk of digital supply chain system, which highlights the role of decision allocation to the IT unit as a key moderator in risk mitigation. The study generates theoretical and practical implications on how IT governance and system modularity may jointly mitigate risk and foster supply chain digitization."

The authors studied seven large U.S. corporations that are exploring how blockchain might improve their supply chain operations. Their early initiatives show that the technology can enable faster and more cost-efficient product delivery, make products more traceable, streamline the financing process, and enhance coordination among buyers, suppliers, and banks. There are special requirements for using blockchain in supply chain management: restricting participation to known, trusted partners; adopting a new consensus protocol; and taking steps to keep errors and counterfeits out of the supply chain.

Risk management is permanent element of management abilities and one of the most important factor impacting on supply chain resilience. Today managers have access to many tools, i.e. digital technologies, supporting the development of contingency plans (Plan B) for risk mitigation. The aim of the paper is to identify supply chain resilience in terms of risk management during the beginning of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread in 2020. The most important factors impacting on supply chain flows stability are pointed here together with the assessment of their preparation for these flows disruption. Methods: The theoretical background is based on the literature review on disruption of supply chain management in general. The In-depth individual interview (IDI) method supported with questionnaire was used to conduct research among managers responsible for supply chain operations within the enterprises from the production, trade and services sectors in Poland. Opinions and a number of views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations and supply chain management were obtained and analyzed. The survey was conducted in March 2020. Results: The results obtained show that the first phase of pandemic spread unexpectedly strongly and impacted on disruption in the supply chains. Closed borders, sanitary and administrative restrictions have leaded to transport delays, additionally the lower number of orders was noted causing many disruptions in the further flow of the goods. Surprisingly the disruption happened even when managers synergistically cooperate and share information among partners. Conclusions: Results of the research pointed out the critical problem with the lack of “Plan B” helping supply chains quickly react on disruptions occurring in the flows. Also managing risk based on the current way of sharing information is insufficient. Features of digital technologies and digitalization are currently one of the most important solution that might help to build smart “Plan B” for risk mitigation and supply chain competitiveness improvement."

Refrigeration is also key to enable successful transcontinental export to distant markets. To minimize the environmental impact of the cold chain and to optimize logistics, a better knowledge of the fruit quality evolution within individual shipments would be extremely valueable. For this purpose, a digital fruit twin is developed, based on mechanistic modeling. This digital twin simulates the thermal behavior of mango fruit throughout the cold chain, based on the measured environmental temperature conditions, namely the air temperature in the vicinity of the fruit. At the same time, the evolution of associated quality attributes, due to enzymatically-driven, temperature-dependent biochemical degradation reactions, is quantified. Also, a biophysical counterpart of real mango fruit – an innovative fruit simulator sensing device – was developed and used for model validation of fruit pulp temperatures. We identified – in-silico – the impact of the unique delivery air temperature history and cold chain length on fruit quality evolution for actual maritime vs. airfreight transport pathways. Digital twins were found to provide complementary insights in the thermophysical behavior of fruit, particularly in supply chains of very perishable species, and for storage at low airflow rates. Such mechanistic modeling enabled to understand, record, and predict where temperature-dependent fruit quality loss occurs in each supply chain. In that way, digital twins can help to improve refrigeration processes and logistics to reduce food losses, thereby making the refrigerated supply chain greener."

Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency.

In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain."

Many existing strategies to strengthen the resilience of supply chains are facilitated by the use of digital technology.

In this paper, we discuss the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain risk management and, in particular, on supply chain resilience. We identify potential risk-related blockchain application scenarios and examine their impact on the existing resilience strategies. We explore the impact of the most promising applications with respect to resilience by using an agent-based simulation model of a complex supply network affected by disruptions. The theoretical analysis reveals a promotion of supply chain resilience strategies, especially if smart contracts are used for risk-related collaboration. The simulation study indicates an increase in resilience if the underlying collaboration is based on time-efficient processes: The propagation of disruptions, the network recovery time, and total costs can be substantially reduced. However, depending on the duration of the disruption, negative effects can occur if process efficiency is insufficient. From our investigations, we derive insights for managers who are interested in practical implementation."

Design/methodology/approach: First, this study performs a critical review of the extant literature to identify major benefits and shortcomings related to the use of either simulation modelling or real-word application of physical IAVs. Second, commercial and bespoke software applications, along with a three-dimensional validation and verification emulation tool, are developed to evaluate an IAV’s operations in a conceptual warehouse. Third, a commercial depth-sensor is used as a test bed in a physical setting. Findings: The results demonstrate that conceptual and simulation modelling should be initially used to explore alternative supply chain operations in terms of ideal performance while emulation tools and real-world IAV test beds are eminent in validating preferred digital supply chain design options. Research limitations/implications: The provided analysis framework was developed using literature evidence along with experimental work and research experience, without consulting any industry experts. In addition, this study was developed based on the application of a single physical device application as a test bed and, thus, the authors should further progress with the testing of a physical IAV in an industrial warehouse. Practical implications: The study provides bespoke simulation modelling and emulation tools that can be useful for supply chain practitioners in effectively designing network operations. Originality/value: This work contributes in the operations management field by providing both a multi-stage methodological framework and a practical “toolbox” for the proactive assessment and incorporation of IAVs in supply network operations."

In this paper we seek to separate hype surrounding DDM from economic reality in order to ground the future research agenda for the Operations Management field. By opposing direct digital manufacturing with traditional tool-based manufacturing, we show that direct digital manufacturing so far lags behind by several orders of magnitude compared to traditional manufacturing methods. Yet we also find that direct digital manufacturing clearly is on an improvement trajectory that eventually will see it being able to compete with traditional manufacturing on a unit cost basis. As such we conclude that direct digital manufacturing will increasingly challenge operations management researchers to question established practices such as scheduling, batch sizing and inventory management in low-volume, high-variety contexts. Furthermore, an increasing adoption of direct digital manufacturing will drive structural shifts in the supply chain that are not yet well understood. We summarize these challenges by defining the research agenda at factory, supply chain, and operations strategy level."

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

Hence, it proposes an algorithm for automated SCF using multiple contract parameters. Moreover, it proposes a decision-making mechanism that provides means for incorporating risk in the decision-making process. To better emphasize the features of the proposed decision-making mechanism, the paper provides some insights from the petroleum industry. This industry has a strategic position, as it is the base for other essential activities of the economy of any country. The petroleum industry is faced with volatile feed-stock costs, cyclical product prices and seasonal final products demand. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have modeled the supply chain in terms of a cluster graph where the nodes are represented by clusters over the contract parameters that suppliers/consumers are interested in. The suppliers/consumers own utility functions and agree on multiple contract parameters by message exchange, directly with other participant agents, representing their potential buyer or seller. The agreed values of the negotiated issues are reflected in a contract which has a certain utility value for every agent. They consider uncertainties in crude oil prices and demand in petrochemical products and model the decision mechanism for a refinery by using an inﬂuence diagram. Findings: By integrating the automated SCF algorithm and a mechanism for decision support under uncertainty, the authors propose a reliable and practical decision-making model with a practical application not only in the petroleum industry but also in any other complex industry involving a multi-tier supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this approach reveals in situations where the parameters can take values over continuous domains. In these cases, storing the preferences for every agent might need a considerable amount of memory depending on the size of the continuous domain; hence, the proposed approach might encounter efficiency issues. Practical implications: The current paper makes a step forward to the implementation of digital supply chains in the context of Industry 4.0. The proposed algorithm and decision-making mechanism become powerful tools that will enable machines to make autonomous decisions in the digital supply chain of the future. Originality/value: The current work proposes a decentralized mechanism for automated SCF. As opposed to the previous decentralized approaches, this approach translates the SCF optimization problem not as a profit maximization problem but as a utility maximization. Hence, it incorporates multiple parameters and uses utility functions to find the optimal supply chain. The current approach is closer to real life scenarios than the previous approaches that were using only cost as a mean for pairwise agents because it uses utility functions for entities in the supply chain to make decision. Moreover, this approach overcomes the limitations of previous approaches by providing means to incorporate risk in the decision-making mechanism."

Many companies are facing financial difficulties and some have shut down due to poor supply chain management practices. Companies have to be smarter by incorporating the necessary technologies to be more competitive and sustain in the global supply chain, that processes can be better managed and automated where necessary. Most companies fail due to poor integrations of technology in their supply chain. It is important that companies be smarter in order to strive hard to reduce cost, improve customer services and to increase return of investments throughout the supply chain. While a few industries are taking a major leap; it is vital for other companies to adopt to the changing nature of the digital supply chains and embrace industry 4.0, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT). The primary goal of this study is to improve inbound and outbound operations to better manage and optimize and automate operations in an ERP system through the use of RFID technology and Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI) technology in SAP ®. The existing ERP system was thoroughly analysed using mixed method approach and was followed-up in assessing how transactions can be better executed in the system. The time taken to execute various process in inbound and outbound operation was measured in two iterations and was analysed to propose a means of improving inbound and outbound operations with the use of technology. The study derives a conceptual framework to enhance inbound and outbound operations in ERP for Fashion Apparel and Footwear Industry."

Managing healthcare records, linking the related healthcare silos and most importantly hospitals and the hospital-supplier linkages have occupied the focal point of discussion in the recent past. Adoption of digital technologies has made headway into the healthcare space. Technologies like Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms are being adopted by the hospitals for a better sync between them and their suppliers, which in turn help them to improve the care-quality and benefits down the line to their patients, besides boosting their own performance measures. EHR and ERP adoption literatures are gradually progressing, and at this juncture, the current study, well-grounded and drawing logical support from two base theories i.e., Cybernetic control theory and Resource-based view, puts forward and rationally links the antecedentconsequence relationship variables. This study, based on detailed extant review of literature, aims at eliciting a nuanced view of how EHR and ERP adoption in the hospital supply chain boosts the patient care quality. This study puts forth a conceptual framework linking the technology adoption (EHR and ERP) to healthcare performance, showcasing patient care quality as the intervening step. This study also puts forth rationally-linked propositions which might provide hospital managers with a better elicited understanding of the gains of EHR and ERP in hospital supply chain and healthcare network context.

Consumers have become more educated and are demanding real-time updated information on foods they consumed through digital media. They are also increasingly demanding to know if the foods they consume are environmentally and socially sustainable or not. As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed."

This examination is undertaken through the lens of the social supply chain as a means to understanding, suggesting and expanding on current research regarding retailing and the UK High Street. The authors reveal some of the challenges being posed by the changing patterns of growth and consumption in cities and couple these with shifting supply chain trends. Design/methodology/approach – A case study approach is used to explore the rapid advances and influence of digital technologies on businesses operating on the primary business street of suburban centre, towns or cities (described in the UK collectively as the “high street”). The research is conducted through the analytical lens of the social supply chain. Findings – Theoretically extending the “social” in the social supply chain, the authors illustrate the usefulness of the nuanced concept of the “social supply chain” with two related strategies concerning delivery and balance. These strategies are themselves interlinked with the actions of co-creation, co-production and co-consumption. Examples of social supply chain strategies presented include retail businesses giving away something as an incentive, where the underlying requirement from the customer is that they will bring their own specialist product, skill or social network to a specified location (real or virtual).

In the traditional supply chain finance, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and a large scale play an irreplaceable role in managing the supply chain information flow, logistics, and capital flow, which results in inequality and information asymmetry. Fraud in supply chain finance is also very serious. To solve the problems of the traditional supply chain finance, in this article, we build a new type of supply chain financial platform that uses blockchain technology to manage the whole process. This supply chain financial platform solves the problem of nontrust among the participants in the supply chain, improves the efficiency of the capital flow and information flow, reduces costs, and provides better financial services to the relevant parties in the supply chain.

Decision making in organizations is a significant system implied task of managers and therefore a broad area in scientific research, not only in the disciplines management or business studies – even from technical to humanistic disciplines. Nowadays the trend of digitalization captures all areas of life especially in business, as well as the typical management task of decision making. Triggered by the digitalization trend business will move toward an autonomous decision making of machines or cyber systems. The important step toward autonomous decisions or decision support (cyber systems will prepare a decision, but finally executed by a human) will be the next development step for decision making. Designed algorithmic models for these decisions will use the content of classical decision models to reach maximum utility. Hence, a view on classical decision making will illuminate the basis for these models, from researchers like von Neumann/Morgenstern or Bernoulli. Furthermore, digitalization changes the process of decision making, especially focussing on the behavioral part of decisions, discussed from Simon, Selten or Tversky/Kahneman. Due to reason that today the human aspect of decision making is sustainable in organizations. The hypothesis that the digital set up for decision making in organizations will increase the efficiency of strategic decisions will be proofed by an empiric study. The research method for the empirical part of this paper is a questionnaire. It is online questionnaire which will be answered by professionals and scholars. As a typical example of a strategic decision, the author explains a business case in the supply chain function of organizations. A section of the well-known SCOR model will be tested on digitalization characteristics. The research findings of the questionnaire will illustrate that the digitalization of supply chain processes is in the scope of managers and consultants, to reach higher efficiency by increased turnover or by reducing costs. The result of this paper verifies an improved decision process by usage of digital features, but the capability of the entire digital possibilities is not fully achieved yet"

Based on the theoretical framework of Sustainable Supply Chain Transparency (SSCT) in Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM), this conceptual article aims at initiating the discussion on digitalization in SSCM. Therefore, a heuristical research framework, based on relevant fields in the management of sustainability oriented transparency (governance, cooperation and partner selection, traceability/tracking, and strategic and operational risk assessment) is developed. In relation to these fields, consequently, data-driven digital approaches are identified to which potentials for SSCT and control can be attributed. This initial analysis of existing digital approaches already shows that the market is developing dynamically, but is driven more by individual initiatives. In many cases, the approaches used so far are still in the trial phase or offer only limited solutions. Therefore, this paper contributes by giving an overview of the current application of the digitalization approaches in SSCM pinning our discussion on SSCT dimensions."

Digital platforms are a technology-enabled business model that facilitates exchanges between interacting agents. They represent a bridging link among disconnected nodes, improving the scalable value of networks. Application to healthcare public-private partnerships (PPPs) is significant due to the consistency of digital platforms with health issues and the complexity of the stakeholder’s interaction. In infrastructural PPPs, public and private players cooperate, usually following PF patterns. This relationship is complemented by digitized supply chains and is increasingly patient-centric. This paper reviews the literature, analyzes some supply chain bottlenecks, addresses solutions concerning the networking effects of platforms to improve PPP interactions, and investigates the cost-benefit analysis of digital health with an empirical case. Whereas diagnostic or infrastructural technology is an expensive investment with long-term payback, leapfrogging digital applications reduce contingent costs. “Digital” savings can be shared by key stakeholders with P4P schemes, incentivizing value co-creation patterns. Efficient sharing may apply network theory to a comprehensive PPP ecosystem where stakeholding nodes are digitally connected. This innovative approach improves stakeholder relationships, which are re-engineered around digital platforms that enhance patient-centered satisfaction and sustainability. Digital technologies are useful even for infectious disease surveillance, like that of the coronavirus pandemic, for supporting massive healthcare intervention, decongesting hospitals, and providing timely big data."

Thus, an intelligent system would be implemented in supply chain management from upstream to downstream. Based on review of 46 scientific papers discussing on types of natural fibre, process, technology, and methods, as well as application areas of natural fibre in downstream industries. According to review on different aspects in 55 scientific papers, there were 5 aspects mapped, i.e. supply chain analytics, value chain, performance, collaboration, big data, and decision support system.

Upcoming research opportunities include mediating relationship in supply chain network by utilizing Internet of things (IoT) and Big data (BD), in a collaborative relationship to use information sharing. The most possibly contributing research is the development of collaboration between supply chain and genetic algorithm [4]. Integration between production and inventory planning becomes an approach that utilizes Particle swarm optimization (PSO) by developing production planning [5], and production and inventory planning [6].

Background: Supply chain sustainability is a central concern of most organizations. The main objective of sustainable supply chains is to create and maintain long term economic, social, and environmental value for all stakeholders involved in delivering products and services to markets. As sustainability constitutes one of the critical drivers of innovation, the recent emergence of blockchain technology typifies the disruptive impact of digital innovation on supply chain sustainability. Blockchain is a foundational technology that poses a shift in the development of supply chain sustainability. Methods: Despite the increasing importance of blockchain in improving supply chain efficiencies and bringing societal changes, research investigating its potentialities from the lens of sustainability is scarce. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap and synthesize the literature from leading journals on the topic of blockchain and its relation to supply chain sustainability. Papers were collected from different scientific databases and carefully analyzed. The possibilities of blockchains are identified and classified according to the triple bottom line framework, namely the economic, social, and environmental dimensions of sustainability. Results and conclusions: The majority of studies focused on the economic implications of blockchains on supply chains. The sustainable economic aspects of the technology identified in the reviewed literature are mostly the transformational potentials of blockchains and their capabilities to drive new disintermediated business models, higher operational efficiencies, cost advantages, and additional sources of value creation. The social empowerment of supply chains is found through the ability of blockchain to create trustful relationships among supply chain partners, increase food safety, support humanitarian logistics, and promote social equity. Moreover, firms attempting to move forward in their environmental policies and strategies can use blockchain to extend their efforts to improve their environmental practices across the supply chain, reduce the strain on energy and natural resources, and offer environmentally friendly products."

Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a platform for new research that addresses gaps in knowledge and advances the field of OSCM. A research agenda is developed around six key themes. Practical implications: There are many opportunities for organisations to obtain an advantage by making use of blockchain technology ahead of the competition, enabling them to enhance their market position. But it is important that managers examine the characteristics of their products, services and supply chains to determine whether they need or would benefit sufficiently from the adoption of blockchain. Moreover, it is important that organisations build human capital expertise that allows them to develop, implement and exploit applications of this technology to maximum reward. Originality/value: This is one of the first papers in a leading international OSCM journal to analyse blockchain technology, thereby complementing a recent article on digital supply chains that omitted blockchain."

This reshapes the extended enterprise from the traditional network of upstream manufacturers and downstream retailers to include midstream third-party and manufacturerowned referral services in the supply chain. We model competition between retailers in a supply chain with such digitally enabled institutions and consider their impact on the optimal contracts among the manufacturer, referral intermediary, and the retailers. Offline, retailers face a higher customer discovery cost. In return, they can engage in price discrimination based on consumer valuations. Online, they save on the discovery costs but lose the ability to identify consumer valuations. This critical trade-off drives firms' equilibrium strategies. We derive the optimal contracts for different entities in the supply chain and highlight how these contracts change with the entry of independent and manufacturer-owned referral services. The establishment of a referral service is a strategic decision by the manufacturer. It leads to diversion of supply chain profit from a third-party infomediary to the manufacturer. Further, it enables the manufacturer to respond to an infomediary, by giving itself greater flexibility in setting the unit wholesale fee to the profit-maximizing level. Both third-party and manufacturer-sponsored referral services play a critical role in enabling retailers to discriminate across consumers' different valuations. Retailers use online referral services to screen out low-valuation consumers and sell only to high-valuation consumers in the online channel. Our model thus endogenously derives a correlation between consumer valuation and online purchase behavior. Finally, we show that under some circumstances, it is too costly for the manufacturer to eliminate the referral infomediary. © 2007 INFORMS."

This article presents a study for improving sustainability practices in the coffee supply chain, using emerging technologies, of two localities in the Frailesca region from Chiapas, Mexico, based on the current situation, expectations and actions expressed by 165 coffee producers and 12 representatives of two coffee producers' organizations. Based on Mentzer theoretical support, the technology roadmaps, knowledge management and digital compass were used to draw coffee supply chain processes to identify concrete actions and explore technologies. The results show that the technological route must be focused on renewing and improving coffee quality, getting quality certifications and access to specialized markets. Digital quality management and advanced statistical process control seem to be the appropriate emerging technologies for enhancing the acquisition of resistant varieties, proper pest management, improvement in the collection of coffee beans, the right time and way to plant a coffee plant, soil analysis and for the management of weeds and water conservation and harvesting as sustainable practices in this region. In addition, statistical correlation showed that digital technologies can be better adopted, on average, by producers with 4-6 family members, aged between 40-44 years and without additional crops. The findings propose sustainable practices linked with emerging technologies, based on a technology roadmap and knowledge management methodologies for this region."

An expert desk review identified eight areas of interest for the vaccine supply chain and informed the development of a survey to assess the relevance of the areas identified. The review also conjectured whether the overall effect of the identified areas is cost-neutral or resulting in net savings to countries. Overall, respondents identified five areas as of highest interest and subsequently an expert working group of representative manufacturers prioritized three of them. Specifically, traceability in the context of global digital health initiatives, stockpiling in the context of addressing vaccine shortages, stock-outs, outbreaks and epidemic prevention, and new packaging technologies are discussed in this report.

Specifically, we propose that these new market conditions can empower downstream firms. We further propose that upstream firms can still capture additional value through digital service if their servitized offer includes difficult to imitate elements. The context of the analysis is the publishing industry. The Payment Card method employed is used to test UK and US consumer's perceptions of digital formats (eBooks) and assess their willingness to pay in relation to printed formats.

Design/methodology/approach: A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation. Findings: The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage. Originality/value: This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-à-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures."

Following an abductive reasoning, we designed iterative loops between theory and practice. The study focuses on patterns observed in data collected through semi-directive UX Designer interviews. Thus, we formulated a hypothesis: the SCI theoretical framework can serve as an analogical analysis framework to better understand the relationships between UX designers and other players in a digital project.

One of the key business functions that is impacted by the implementation of different disruptive technologies is the supply chain management. As a result, there is a continuous need to identify where digitalizing supply chains may provide businesses with benefits to capitalize such gains. This study aims to examine potential impacts of digitalizing supply chains on five selected lean operations practices through the identification of key areas and benefits under each of these practices. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 74 participants mainly from the academic community and who were university scholars through the use of an online survey. The used online survey consists of six main parts in total, but three were included in this paper and these were designed to gather data about participants’ general information, level of influence of seven technological trends on supply chain performance and management and potential impact of digitalizing supply chains on five lean operations practices. Findings: The authors were able to confirm the significant impact of digitalizing supply chains on the five examined lean operations practices. Most of the examined potential impacts were found to improve certain areas that directly improve the practices of the explored five lean operations practices as well as the overall supply chain and business performance. They were also able to determine the level of influence of the seven examined enabling technologies on supply chain performance and management. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first of its kind. Although some literature explored different aspects related to the concept of Industry 4.0 and digitalizing supply chains, no study has specifically explored potential impacts of digitalizing supply chains on lean operations. The results from this study can be beneficial to academic scholars interested in the researched themes, business professionals specializing in supply chain management and lean operations, organizations within different industrial sectors particularly manufacturing where lean thinking is adopted and any other party interested in understanding more about the impact of digitalizing supply chain on lean operations and on an overall business performance."

The majority of waste occurs at the interface of retailers and consumers. Many global retailers are making efforts to extract intelligence from customer’s complaints left at retail store to backtrack their supply chain to mitigate the waste. However, majority of the customers don’t leave the complaints in the store because of various reasons like inconvenience, lack of time, distance, ignorance etc. In current digital world, consumers are active on social media and express their sentiments, thoughts, and opinions about a particular product freely. For example, on an average, 45,000 tweets are tweeted daily related to beef products to express their likes and dislikes. These tweets are large in volume, scattered and unstructured in nature. In this study, twitter data is utilised to develop waste minimization strategies by backtracking the supply chain. The execution process of proposed framework is demonstrated for beef supply chain.

Once a consensus is reached, the data for the transactions cannot be changed and becomes the data of record. The storage of data across the network, rather than in one place, and the inability to change data make blockchain a secure way of recording transactions. For the supply chain, this means more consistent records rather than the disputes and correc-tions that occur for many organizations. This technology also has applications for any track-ing that occurs in the supply chain because it enables organizations to maintain accurate and secure data among partners. Blockchain clearly has the potential to improve the way organizations conduct transac-tions and track items within the supply chain. Yet the research conducted by DSCI and APQC indicates that only 1% of the responding organizations are currently using blockchain in their supply chain operations, and only 35% are currently exploring the use of blockchain. Nearly 50% of organizations are neither using nor exploring the use of this technology. When asked where in the supply chain they are using or considering the use of blockchain, logistics (26% of respondents) and procurement (20% of respondents) are the key areas of focus. Fifteen percent are using or exploring blockchain B lockchain, or distributed ledger technology, has become well known among some circles because of its relationship to bitcoin. Conceived as a way to record transactions among those involved in a transaction with-out the use of financial institutions, blockchain's secure technology has additional applications in the business world. In a recent APQC survey of supply chain pro-fessionals, about one-third indicated that blockchain has the potential to create a competitive advantage for their organizations over the next 10 years. About 10% of respondents felt that blockchain would be a potential disruptor for their industry within the same time period. However, there is a gap between the enthu-siasm of organizations familiar with blockchain and its potential, and the opinions of organiza-tions that have had little exposure to the con-cept of blockchain. A recent study conducted by the Digital Supply Chain Institute (DSCI) at the Center for Global Enterprise, in partner-ship with APQC, revealed that over one-third of supply chain professionals surveyed are either extremely or moderately unfamiliar with blockchain. Some organizations have begun investigating blockchain and considering its uses for their business, but they are still exer-cising caution as they weigh the potential ben-efits of this technology against the barriers to its implementation."

However, current systems are limited to tracing simple goods that have not been part of the manufacturing process. We recommend a method that allows for the traceability of manufactured goods, including their components. Products are represented using non-fungible digital tokens that are created on a blockchain for each batch of manufactured products. To create a link between a product and the components that are needed to produce it, we propose “token recipes” that define the amount of tokenized goods required for minting a new token. As input tokens are automatically and transparently consumed when creating a product token, the physical process of producing a new item out of existing components is projected onto the ledger. This ultimately leads to the complete traceability of goods, including the origin of inputs. Evaluating the performance of the system, we show that a prototypical implementation for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) scales linearly with the amount of the input and goods tracked."

Together, these technologies drive more efficient, productive and traceable supply chains, which can help to build more effective animal traceability systems. In addition, they can improve monitoring of, and response to, animal disease, food safety risks and food fraud risks; ensure compliance with animal health and food safety standards; simplify border procedures; facilitate trade with less friction; and raise consumer awareness. As the cost of these technologies decline and they become more accessible, the implementation of a digitally enabled animal traceability system will require an increase in supply chain capacity, improvements in digital infrastructure, and the development of a regulatory framework of standards and policies. Ensuring that these requirements are met will require strong commitment from governments, intergovernmental organisations and the wider animal health community."

To illustrate, the agency model utilized by the e-book publishing industry has recently received much negative attention brought by the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple, Inc. The emerging agency model in the e-book industry works as follows: the publisher sets the price of the digital goods and the retailers who serve as agents retain a percentage of the revenue associated with a consumer purchase. The regulators claim that the agency model is hurting this industry as well as the consumer's welfare because e-book prices have increased after the introduction of the agency model. We investigate the strategic impact of the agency model by examining a digital goods supply chain with one supplier and two competing retailers. In comparison to the benchmark wholesale model, we find that the agency model can coordinate the competing retailers by dividing the coordinated profits into a prenegotiated revenue sharing proportion. Further, we also identify the Pareto improving region whereby both the supplier and the retailers prefer the agency model to the wholesale model. Our main qualitative insight regarding the agency model still holds even when we consider the presence of the printed books in the marketplace. Thus, contrary to current press presaging the negative impact of the agency model on the e-books industry, we find the agency model to be superior to the traditional wholesale contracts for publishers, retailers and consumers in this digital goods industry."

When products reach the End-of-Life (EoL) stage, the Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) is responsible for managing operations, with greater efforts being needed to improve the associated information infrastructure. In fact, this has become increasingly feasible due to the emergence of a new digital revolution led by the Internet of Things (IoT). To shed light on this matter, we propose the Circular Supply Chain (CSC) framework for EoL management aimed at satisfying the information infrastructure requirements in a particular scenario for the recovery of Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB) packs. We present a qualitative evaluation of the CSC information requirements, and the capabilities of IoT to satisfy them. As a result, a heterogeneous IoT network deployment is proposed in pursuit of a digital CSC information infrastructure."

Recent increases in piracy can be historically traced to the digital revolution, introduction of the World Wide Web, and growth of broadband technologies, rather than a sudden shift in consumer behavior. The digital and Internet paradigm shifts have fundamentally changed supply chain ecosystems, as well as opened the door to greater acts of piracy. Under these new ecosystems, digital rights management (DRM) has proven ineffective at stopping piracy. Furthermore, DRM systems have been shown to discourage legitimate buyers. A new approach to piracy is needed to account for recent changes in supply chain ecosystems. Several industry leaders demonstrate effective solutions combining technology and innovative business models that encourage consumers toward legitimate consumption while leveraging piracy. Given these examples, industries can address online piracy by combining appropriate technology, innovative business models, and piracy analytics in the evolving supply chain ecosystems. © 2012 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University."

Its application in supply chain management is also gradually increasing. Supply chain management (SCM) has long been committed to reducing costs and increasing efficiency and is trying to optimise resources and reduce the sector's fragmentation. Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures. Originality/value: This study builds upon an original data set and discusses features and applications of blockchain technology, explores the sources and dimensions of trust in supply chain management and explains the impact of blockchain technology on trust."

This research explores the challenges posed in the development and deployment of 3DP and focuses on China, which is still the main manufacturing hub of the world. The main purpose of this research is to uncover the obstacles that resist mass-scale applications of 3DP. By means of empirical semi-structured interviews with 3DP companies in China, it is found that many companies can see the benefits of 3DP, but its potential has not been delivered as promised. One reason is due to the fact that 3DP has not been integrated well in the supply chain. The other reason concerns potential intellectual property issues that cannot effectively prevent counterfeiting. To tackle the above issues, several areas have been identified that could be improved further. In particular, the legal complications concerning 3D-printed content could be overcome by a licensing platform."

Despite the obvious problems, digitalization is being actively implemented in the power industry. It is noted that the target model of digitalization in the power industry should include three blocks: digital technologies and databases, information technology infrastructure, including communication channels, information security systems. The spheres of application of existing and future digital technologies and databases at all stages of energy production are considered: generation, power grids, sales activities, in their relationship with the management bodies of the wholesale and retail electricity and capacity markets and regulatory bodies. The possibilities of using own and leased communication channels are criticallyevaluated, the advantages of various communication channels are revealed.

We present the results of a simulation study that opens some new research tensions on the impact of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) on the global SCs. First, we articulate the specific features that frame epidemic outbreaks as a unique type of SC disruption risks. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SC performance using the example of coronavirus COVID-19 and anyLogistix simulation and optimization software. We offer an analysis for observing and predicting both short-term and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs along with managerial insights. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the timing of the closing and opening of the facilities at different echelons might become a major factor that determines the epidemic outbreak impact on the SC performance rather than an upstream disruption duration or the speed of epidemic propagation. Other important factors are lead-time, speed of epidemic propagation, and the upstream and downstream disruption durations in the SC. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the SCs and develop pandemic SC plans.

With a growing demand for deep digital and technical experience in supply chain processes, the workforce must be comfortable with data-driven decision-making and have a complete understanding of true end-to-end supply chains. Humans + machines = The multiplier effect Over the past decade, basic automation and analytics, coupled with the widespread adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and Cloud computing technologies, have improved the operational efficiency of supply chain processes. Beyond the factory floor, robots are now supplementing and augmenting human roles in such knowledge-intensive areas as supply chain planning, customer order management and inventory management. [...]prescriptive analytics, which not only anticipate what will happen but also suggest options to capture opportunities and mitigate risks, can be applied across multiple supply chain areas to enhance the chances of human planners achieving optimal outcomes. Furthermore, leveraging analytics, cognitive equipment and smart apps provides the right information for decision-making, while seamless human-machine interactions increase operational efficiency."

This social metabolism enables the flows of energy and materials between social and natural environments to be analyzed and quantified. However, in the last century, many societies have undergone a transformation from an agricultural to an industrial system. Thus, labour, as a generator of economic capital through the supply chain, has provoked a loss of natural and social capital, especially in emerging economies, thereby generating the metabolic rift. This situation can be mitigated and reversed through a circular economy, the use of digital and technological enablers of Industry 4.0 and the incorporation of an organizational enabler such as the holonic paradigm. The integration of these enablers has given rise to the development of the cyber-physical holon, which incorporates inherently sustainable concepts and allows the analysis of distributed complex systems. This paper proposes a holonic framework for multiscale and multilevel Adaptive and Integrated Sustainable Supply Chain Management (AISSCM). This framework supports a smart connected social metabolism integrated within the natural environment and oriented towards mitigation and reversal of the metabolic rift, through the processes of adaptation and integration to enable the co-evolution of the supply chain within the environment. The framework developed is applied to a family of products through their sustainable supply chain based on circularity. This proposal is developed to enable the necessary transition towards sustainable societies."

Prior studies show that Industry 4.0 adoption majorly influences the sustainability aspects in a supply chain network. The purpose of this paper is to identify the Industry 4.0 enablers of supply chain sustainability and further attempt to propose a research framework to bridge the theoretical gaps. Design/methodology/approach: In this research study, the authors have used a systematic literature review methodology in the field of Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply chain management. The list of papers was downloaded from Scopus (www.scopus.com) database. Through strict screening, only journal papers were selected for conducting the review of the literature. Findings: The review brings out some interesting findings which will be helpful for the research community. There have been limited research in the area of managing supply chain network sustainability through Industry 4.0 technologies. The authors found only 10 papers out of a total of 53 papers which emphasize on smart manufacturing, smart production system, smart warehouse management system, smart logistics and sustainability. Most of the previous research studies have ignored the social aspects of supply chain sustainability. Finally, the authors identified 13 key enablers of Industry 4.0 playing an important role in driving supply chain sustainability. Practical implications: The strategies for Industry 4.0 should be refined and detailed to develop economic and social systems that can act flexibly to sudden changes in the system. Top management must be convinced for prioritizing investment support and creating a system that can facilitate technology convergence. Managers must also act on new models of employment and frame plans to continuously improve the system. In addition, managers must focus on establishing a collaborative platform to facilitate high-tech research and developments. Finally, it is essential to develop a performance management system for monitoring all actions in the supply chain network. Originality/value: Integrating two independent subjects is the uniqueness of the current study. Here, Industry 4.0 and supply chain sustainability have been integrated to build the research framework, and in such a process, the authors have extended the existing knowledge base."

The purpose of this paper is to introduce an alternative where DDM coexists with and complements traditional mass production. When multiple parts run across one manufacturing line, DDM can isolate variability associated with low volume part production and may be preferred to mass production despite being expensive. If DDM complements rather than cannibalizes mass production, this alters the understanding of who adopts DDM, the products built with DDM, and DDM’s long-term supply chain implications. Design/methodology/approach – This invited paper explores a DDM rollout scenario and qualitatively assesses potential supply chain reconfigurations. Findings – The analysis recognizes that existing manufacturers with heterogeneous bills-of-material may develop DDM capabilities to isolate disruptive, low-volume production from scalable mass production. Developing DDM competence and raw material scale advantages, these manufacturers become the locus of change in a manufacturing landscape increasingly characterized by multi-product DDM supercenters. Originality/value – Extant research largely focusses on two potential reasons for DDM adoption: cost-per-unit and time-to-delivery comparisons. The authors explore a third driver: DDM’s capacity to isolate manufacturing variability attributable to low volume parts. Relative to the extant literature, this suggests a different DDM rollout, different adopters, and a different supply chain configuration. The authors identify mass manufacturing variability reduction as the mechanism through which DDM may be adopted. This adoption trajectory would eventually enable a supply chain transition in which spare parts inventory migrates from finished goods at proprietary facilities to raw materials at generalized DDM supercenters."

Block-chain technologies are finding applications in various areas such as Supply chains, banking, healthcare and Internet of Things. By making use of timestamps we can utilise some major features offered by the Blockchain technology. Like, lastingness, distributed amongst its peers, by making use of these attributes, one can be assured transactions can be made sturdier and more transparent. By design, the Block-chain enforces transparency, security, authenticity, and auditability. When it comes to supply chain management, it could make it easier for big businesses to track all the verifiable details for every single order on the supply chain. As an incorruptible digital ledger, Block-chain could effectively store records for every product. In conclusion, Block-chain has the potential to drive cost-saving efficiencies and enhance the consumer’s experience through transparency, traceability, and trade-ability in various fields of applications like Supply chain management. Nodes of the Block-chain network can generate keys, hashes and transactions blocks. This paper attempts to address the necessity of a central authority which can only initiate the requests and changes which will not destroy the perks offered by the decentralization feature of Block-chain technology but further helps the users use it even more efficiently.

This paper demonstrates the potential effects of digital twins in trade-in policymaking through a simulated product-recovery system through blockchain technology. A discrete event simulation model is developed from the manufacturer's viewpoint to obtain a data-driven trade-in pricing policy in a fully transparent platform. The model maps and mimics the behavior of the product-recovery activities based on predictive indicators.

For many products, the operational outcome of the retail supply chain is determined by the customer physically fitting products. Digital product fitting is an emerging operational practice in retail that uses digital models of products and customers to match product supply to customer requirements. This paper aims to explore potential supply chain outcomes of digitalizing the operational practice of product fitting. The purpose is to explore and propose the potential of the practice to improve responsiveness to customer requirements and the utilization of existing variety in mass-produced products. Design/methodology/approach: A maturity model of product fitting is developed to specify three levels of digitalization and potential outcomes for each level. Potential outcomes are developed based on empirical data from a case survey of three technology-developing companies, 13 retail cases and a review of academic literature. Findings: With increasing maturity of digital product fitting, the practice can be used for more purposes. Besides matching product supply to customer demand, the practice can improve material flows, customer relationship management, assortment planning and product development. The practice of digital product fitting is most relevant for products where the final product configuration is difficult to make to order, product and customer attributes are easily measurable and tacit knowledge of customers and products can be formalized using digital modeling. Research limitations/implications: Potential outcomes are conceptualized and proposed. Further research is needed to observe actual outcomes and understand the mechanisms for both proposed and surprising outcomes in specific contexts. Practical implications: The maturity model helps companies assess how their operations can benefit from digital product fitting and the efforts required to achieve beneficial outcomes. Originality/value: This paper is a first attempt to describe the potential outcomes of introducing digital product fitting in retail supply chains."

The goal of this research is to present a comprehensive review of blockchain adoption barriers in the context of humanitarian supply chain management. An integrated approach using Fuzzy Delphi and Best-Worst method (BWM) has been used for analyzing the barriers. Based on the literature, 14 barriers of the blockchain adoption in humanitarian supply chain were identified. According to the Fuzzy Delphi result, 9 barriers were accepted. After that, the BWM calculated the importance of each barrier. The findings showed that regulatory uncertainty, lack of knowledge/employee training and high sustainability costs are the important barriers.

Beyond vertical programs, health systems research should examine system-wide delivery platforms (e.g. health facilities) and operational elements (e.g. supply chains) as primary units of study and evaluation. Methods: We use dynamical system methods to develop a simple analytical model for the supply chain of a low-income country's health system. In doing so, we emphasize the dynamic links that integrate the supply chain within other elements of the health system; and we examine how the evolution over time of such connections would affect drug delivery, following the implementation of selected interventions (e.g. enhancing road networks, expanding workforce). We also test feedback loops and forecasts to study the potential impact of setting up a digital system for tracking drug delivery to prevent drug stockout and expiration. Results: Numerical simulations that capture a range of supply chain scenarios demonstrate the impact of different health system strengthening interventions on drug stock levels within health facilities. Our mathematical modeling also points to how implementing a digital drug tracking system could help anticipate and prevent drug stockout and expiration. Conclusion: Our mathematical model of drug supply chain delivery represents an important component toward the development of comprehensive quantitative frameworks that aim at describing health systems as complex dynamical systems. Such models can help predict how investments in system-wide interventions, like strengthening drug supply chains in low-income settings, may improve population health outcomes."

Digital information systems can enable real time visibility of inventory and improve vaccine availability. In 2014, a digital, mobile/web-based information system was implemented in two districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. This retrospective investigates improvements and stabilization of supply chain performance following introduction of the digital information system. Methods All data were collected via the digital information system between March 2014 and September 2015. Data included metadata and transaction logs providing information about users, facilities, and vaccines. Metrics evaluated include adoption (system access, timeliness and completeness), data quality (error rates), and performance (stock availability on immunization session days, replenishment response duration, rate of zero stock events). Stability was defined as the phase in which quality and performance metrics achieved equilibrium rates with minimal volatility. The analysis compared performance across different facilities and vaccines. Results Adoption appeared sufficiently high from the onset to commence stability measures of data quality and supply chain performance. Data quality stabilized from month 3 onwards, and supply chain performance stabilized from month 13 onwards. For data quality, error rates reduced by two thirds post stabilization. Although vaccine availability remained high throughout the pilot, the three lowest-performing facilities improved from 91.05% pre-stability to 98.70% post-stability (p < 0.01; t-test). Average replenishment duration (as a corrective response to stock-out events) decreased 52.3% from 4.93 days to 2.35 days (p < 0.01; t-test). Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine was significantly less likely to be stocked out than any other material. Conclusion The results suggest that given sufficient adoption, stability is sequentially achieved, beginning with data quality, and then performance. Identifying when a pilot stabilizes can enable more predictable, reliable cost estimates, and outcome forecasts in the scale-up phase."

To consider the effects of piracy on demand, a Stackelberg game is utilized to determine the optimal gain-sharing ratio and the equilibrium prices for all channel members with an aim to maximize the profit of the entire supply chain. It is found that an increase in piracy would force retailers to compete in a smaller market, and thus lead to a decrease in profits for each channel member.

It is also important for efficient coordination of the logistics required to tackle the disaster itself, with vital information flows to centralized agencies leading the response as well as to decentralized agents upstream and downstream in a supply chain. Publicly visible information about the supply chain at the time of a crisis needs to be secure, timely, possibly selective in terms of access and the nature of information, and often anonymous. Recent advances in distributed ledger technology allow for these characteristics to be met. Building digital infrastructure that permits visibility of the supply chain when needed (even if dormant during normal times) is essential for economies to be more resilient to black swan events."

Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers.

In present era if urban consumers wants to purchase fruits and vegetables they use search engine and search for the best deal. Digital marketing play an important role over there. The e-commerce companies of perishable goods (fruits and vegetables) compete to each for best search engine optimization result. Every company want to display its website on the top of the first page of google, bing and yahoo search engine. The supply chain management also play an important role for these e-commerce companies. The supply chain management should be based on least possible time to deliver the products to the ultimate customers. Consumers want products as soon as possible. This is the main reason that there is a very high competetion among the service providers.

An important element of building a competitive advantage of small and medium-sized enterprises may be the implementation of a model for their digital transformation as an element of a wider concept of digital supply chains. Methods: The article uses the method of ""case study"" and questionnaire research to develop a model of digital transformation of enterprises from the SME sector. It is worth pointing out that small and medium-sized enterprises are the most numerous group of institutional participants in the modern market economy. The work uses the concept of the Digitization Index and quality tools, which include, inter alia, Ishikawa diagram and SWOT analysis. The research environment was a manufacturing company from the furniture industry, also acting as the main coordinator between all the links with which it cooperates within the supply chain Results: The article describes the phenomena of digital transformation, which is the main driving force of the digital economy and digitization, which is an indispensable element of transforming business models in accordance with its principles. The final effect of digital transformation of supply chains, which is the creation of new business models based on the properties of digital solutions, called digital supply chains, was also characterized. As a result of the considerations, a concept for building a digital transformation model for enterprises in the SME sector was proposed. Conclusions: The model of digital transformation of enterprises in the SME sector should include both the assessment of the current level of digitization of the enterprise as well as the proposal of its digital transformation. Increasing the degree of digitization of the enterprise surveyed as part of the case study will allow, in the long run, to achieve an increase in the effectiveness of the tasks performed, mainly in terms of reducing the time of their execution and improving the efficiency of information flow between all participants in the supply chain."

Drawing on this analysis, we derive an endogenous demand for auditing to overcome what we label the “first mile problem” (FMP) with blockchains: ensuring that the data stored on the blockchain distributed ledger is isomorphic with the real life data that it purports to represent. The first mile problem arises only when the blockchain is used to store data about physical items, especially ones involving a service component, rather than being native digital, as is the case with the genesis blockchain application, bitcoin. We show that unless it is feasible to store a “digital twin” of the item (Roberts, 2017), there is a role for auditors, with the training in professional skepticism, to help alleviate the first mile problem. There is no guarantee, however, that this new demand for auditing will be met by the traditional financial statement auditors."

Printed/Organic Electronics, now an industry on its own right and recognized as one of the key technological enablers for the Internet of Things, is largely complementary to silicon because the printed transistors are slow and the printed elements are large.

We further review the application space of printed/organic electronics and the supply chain, including their classifications and delineate the associated challenges in each constituent chain. These challenges, largely unresolved, are indeed formidable, and are discussed with a critical circuits and systems perspective. Our review depicts that contemporary design philosophies and methodologies for silicon are largely inadequate for printed/organic electronics.

However, the parties involved in the agrifood supply chain are numerous and physically dispersed, which makes data and information management difficult. As a result, the production process is not transparent and trust is difficult to build. In the horticultural sector, technological innovation in traceability is crucial from a economical point of view. An increasing demand in society for greater information about food reflects the need for more transparency. At the same time, more and more fresh products are accompanied by a variety of certification schemes, with an increasing risk of fraud and adulteration. Within this context, cooperatives of fresh fruits and vegetables can gain additional benefits from the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper seeks to make an initial contribution to the emerging public debate on this issue by providing an overview of blockchain and its application in agriculture, examining implications for food transparency and identifying some potential challenges for agri-food cooperatives. Based on the above reasons, the main purpose of this article is to conceptualize, design and test a traceability system of the agri-food supply chain based on blockchain technology that helps agri-food cooperatives to improve transparency regarding the origin and the processes incorporated into the product. Methodology A new model that involves blockchain and a smart contract to coordinate the tracking of food in the agriculture supply chain is presented in this paper. The food supply chain involves many different actors such as farmers, manufacturers, logistics, wholesalers, resellers, retailers and supermarkets. This system is currently inefficient and unreliable. In the current situation, much of the data and information on compliance are recorded on paper or stored in a centralized database. Through the development of a Proof of Concept (PoC) in the field of agri-food supply chain traceability, the possible implications of the blockchain are explored. The PoC based on a case related to the berries of southern Spain is developed through the construction of a demonstrator that monitors the different nodes involved in the supply chain. The demonstrator is based on a previous analysis of the berries supply chain and the interactions between farmers, the cooperative, its certifiers, logistics providers, retailers and supermarkets, in order to allow a digital representation of a batch of berries to be associated with a unique and immutable digital certificate. To prove the origin and the traceability of the berries production and to be able to customize the roles of each actor in the supply chain with blockchain, the PoC concept was developed in a Spanish farmers cooperative with a permissioned ledger (hyperledger) and a smart contract. Results At the moment, few would question the relevance of blockchain to agri-food. The main question of adopting blockchain technology in the traceability of goods in the agri-food supply chain, is related to the added value compared to existing ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) solutions. This PoC has shown that it is feasible to incorporate basic information from the field and manufacturing processes, packaging and shipping into a chain of blocks with an authorized general ledger and a smart contract. Compared to traditional situations with centralized databases, the PoC demonstrator shows how blockchain can be used to ensure that different agents share the same level of information about the validity and provenance of inviolable certificates. This new supply chain architecture via blockchain can provide the relevant data to the participants, it can maintain confidentiality and can spread data effectively among the participants that use the blockchain technology. Therefore, the PoC pilot demonstrated that the blockchain technology could be used successfully in that context. Furthermore, given the experimentation carried out, it was shown that a medium-sized server (eg VPS in cloud) could function properly as a node for the purposes of this type of use case. There was also no need for special hardware, and the software infrastructure (eg Hyperledger Fabric) is open source and for free. During the development of the PoC, it was learned that it is important to maintain periodic dialogues between stakeholders in order to achieve a better understanding of the interests of each one and to identify common bases for the application of blockchain. The experience in this project shows that the meetings, in which different stakeholders presented and debated different use cases, are a good mechanism for expanding the agri-food blockchain ecosystem. Conclusions The advantage of this model over the centralized models is that all the products are tracked with blockchain and with this traceability it is possible to give confidence to the final consumers about the origin of the products because all the data and transactions carried out in the chain are recorded in the blockchain and managed through a smart contract. The PoC shows that this system is efficient, safe, transparent and avoids intermediaries, which results in lower costs while generating greater confidence in retailers, supermarkets and consumers, which is particularly beneficial for small farmers and cooperatives The research findings contribute to a better understanding of the blockchain technology for the various stakeholders in the fresh food chain, especially for cooperatives, being an opportunity for the improvement of reputation and competitiveness in a highly globalized economy. Several limitations were found for the PoC demonstrator. First, the amount of data and information that is shared is very limited. As with most PoC pilots, the project has not yet been able to demonstrate how the system would work when handling a large number of transactions. In addition, our demonstrator focused on a single smart contract. In practice, however, multiple smart contracts would need to be implemented for the different contractual relationships and to keep the transaction data visible only to the relevant subset of participants. Mistakes in the smart contract design have also shown that testing, validation and rigorous semantics are essential to avoiding significant damage to business relationships. Finally, to take full advantage of the power of blockchain, the adoption of this technology by several cooperatives is recommended. Most cooperatives are too small or have a lack of knowledge to invest in blockchain by themselves. In summary, blockchain is a promising technology for the competitiveness of cooperatives. The near future will show if blockchain technology will become a reliable and transparent way to provide a differential value for agri-food cooperatives."

The article reflects the results of studies based on an interdisciplinary approach to the economic development by supply chain strategy and labor partnership. The work is aimed at clarifying the concept of supply chain management and labor partnership as an economic category. Therefore, this concept has been studied through the synthesis of jurisprudence, conflict management, sociology and political science, which allows to identify the economic and microeconomic substances of this phenomenon. The former is considered through the labor market trends and conditions, and quantified in derived parameters of supply chain and social-labor relations depending on it. The latter, as a specific type of management, is formed at the intersection of entrepreneurial, systemic management under limited conditions for self-management model implementation, typical for modern transition to the information, digital economy. Thus, a model of supply chain strategy and labor partnership has been developed as a microeconomic category, implying the impact characteristic of such management tools as investments in human capital, development of corporate culture, adequacy of compensation policies and supply chain responsibility tools, on social capital, considered as a synergistic amount of company's human capital realized to the full.

However, the integration of digital technology requires investments and changes in a company's internal practices through the mobilization of new resources, as well as by implementing specific capabilities to manage them. The objective of this research work is therefore to examine the impact of SMEs’ digital transformation on their internationalization capability. Relying on an extensive exploratory literature review, digital facilitators were identified and classified into three categories: e-commerce, e-marketing, and e-business. Then, a cross-analysis between the identification of digital facilitators from the literature and a framework of SMEs’ export practices (the Potential Export Index, Enjolras et al., 2016) was conducted in order to highlight differentiated impacts that can be theoretically identified. The most impacted export practices are related to the strategic vision of the firm, the customization of its offerings, its network dynamic, and its internal organization.

A research model is developed to investigate the hierarchy of IT-related capabilities and their impact on firm performance. Data were collected from 110 supply chain and logistics managers in manufacturing and retail organizations. Our results suggest that integrated IT infrastructures enable firms to develop the higher-order capability of supply chain process integration. This capability enables firms to unbundle information flows from physical flows, and to share information with their supply chain partners to create information-based approaches for superior demand planning, for the staging and movement of physical products, and for streamlining voluminous and complex financial work processes. Furthermore, IT-enabled supply chain integration capability results in significant and sustained firm performance gains, especially in operational excellence and revenue growth.

The purpose of this study is to utilize the experience of supply chain practitioners, to ascertain the current level of adoption of a number of key Industry 4.0 technologies, understand what preparatory measures are being taken by firms to ensure they are digitally-ready to utilise Industry 4.0 technologies, recognise how and where these technologies are likely impact supply chains, and investigate whether organisational size is a factor in technology adoption. This empirical study utilises primary data from a descriptive survey of supply chain practitioners working across a range of industry sectors and different stages in the supply chain. Whilst the findings from this research indicate that some Industry 4.0 technologies are still in the early stages of adoption, amongst Australian supply chain organisations, they clearly show which technologies are anticipated to have the greatest impact, what sectors that impact will most likely occur in, and which specific improvements they are expected to drive. Larger firms were found to be more digitally-ready than smaller firms, and a number of significant gaps were identified between expected impact and expected investment, meaning little spend is currently projected for certain technologies that are expected to have a significant impact."

The objective of this study is to estimate the impact of this intervention on vaccine availability. Methods: Monthly stock-out data were collected from paper registers at facilities, an Excel-based system at districts, and the new system (TImR) across all 924 health facilities in Arusha, Tanga and Kilimanjaro Regions. Six months of stockout rates pre- and post-introduction, by antigen, were compared via a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A mixed-effects logistic regression model with the TImR data identified predictors of vaccine availability across antigens. Findings: Post-introduction, ANOVA models estimated that overall stock-out rates declined from a monthly average of 7.1% to 2.1% (p < 0.01). Three specific vaccines had fewer stock-outs; OPV's monthly average dropped from 12.5% to 2.1% (p < 0.01), MR from 9.4% to 1.0% (p < 0.01) and DTP-HepB-HiB from 8.1% to 1.7% (p < 0.01). In the mixed-effects logistic regression model, controlling for antigen, odds of stock-out were 4.1% (95% CI: 3.3 – 4.9) lower for each week of tenure. Compared to DTP-HepB-HiB vaccine, odds of BCG vaccine being stocked out were 4.31 as high (95% CI: 3.1 – 5.0). The odds of being stocked-out were 29.7% lower for PCV (95% CI: 8.8 – 45.8) and 26.6% (95% CI: 3.4 – 44.1) lower for rotavirus vaccines compared to DTP-HepB-HiB. The odds of stock out were 37.7% lower for MR vaccine than DTP-HepB-HiB (95% CI: 18.1 – 52.6). Conclusions: Tanzania's integrated EIR-eLMIS may increase vaccine availability compared to its paper and Excel based system. Post-introduction of an eLMIS, the odds of a vaccine stock-out reduced over time. Further research could determine the impact of this intervention on vaccine wastage and replenishment response times."

Background: Competitive supply chain management is the ability not only to take corrective actions against the risk occurred, but above all prevents such a situation on a daily basis. Risk management is permanent element of management abilities and one of the most important factor impacting on supply chain resilience. Today managers have access to many tools, i.e. digital technologies, supporting the development of contingency plans (Plan B) for risk mitigation. The aim of the paper is to identify supply chain resilience in terms of risk management during the beginning of the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 pandemic spread in 2020. The most important factors impacting on supply chain flows stability are pointed here together with the assessment of their preparation for these flows disruption. Methods: The theoretical background is based on the literature review on disruption of supply chain management in general. The In-depth individual interview (IDI) method supported with questionnaire was used to conduct research among managers responsible for supply chain operations within the enterprises from the production, trade and services sectors in Poland. Opinions and a number of views on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations and supply chain management were obtained and analyzed. The survey was conducted in March 2020. Results: The results obtained show that the first phase of pandemic spread unexpectedly strongly and impacted on disruption in the supply chains. Closed borders, sanitary and administrative restrictions have leaded to transport delays, additionally the lower number of orders was noted causing many disruptions in the further flow of the goods. Surprisingly the disruption happened even when managers synergistically cooperate and share information among partners. Conclusions: Results of the research pointed out the critical problem with the lack of “Plan B” helping supply chains quickly react on disruptions occurring in the flows. Also managing risk based on the current way of sharing information is insufficient. Features of digital technologies and digitalization are currently one of the most important solution that might help to build smart “Plan B” for risk mitigation and supply chain competitiveness improvement."

Such areas include the emergence of cell and gene therapies, the economics of cures, digital technologies, mobile apps, social media, supply chain technologies such as drones and online distribution, universal health coverage and funding, and consumerisation of healthcare. The question to be asked is whether these sorts of changes are “disruptive” or whether they were coming for a long time and it is just that health systems are slow to change. It could be argued that while perhaps unexpected by day-to-day practitioners in healthcare, in fact, many of the changes now starting to affect the health and medicines sector have been affecting other sectors such as technology, finance and communications for decades."

Companies are still struggling to grasp the extent of their cyber risk exposure, and this creates an unnecessary roadblock for every organisation that could benefit from cyber risk transfer. It would be reasonable to assume that companies are shifting their risk perception from the physical to the digital and in turn adjusting the way they insure against risk. However, firms remain chronically underinsured against cyber risk.

The Industry 4.0 has the ambition to revolutionize industry management and business processes, enhancing the productivity of manufacturing technologies through field data collection and analysis, thus creating real-time digital twins of industrial scenarios. Moreover, it is vital for companies to be as “smart” as possible and to adapt to the varying nature of the digital supply chains. This is possible by leveraging IoT in Industry 4.0 scenarios. In this paper, we describe the renovation process, guided by things2i s.r.l., a cross-disciplinary engineering-economic spin-off company of the University of Parma, which a real manufacturing industry is undergoing over consecutive phases spanning a few years. The first phase concerns the digitalization of the control quality process, specifically related to the company's production lines. The use of paper sheets containing different quality checks has been made smarter through the introduction of a digital, smart, and Web-based application, which is currently supporting operators and quality inspectors working on the supply chain through the use of smart devices. The second phase of the IIoT evolution—currently on-going—concerns both digitalization and optimization of the production planning activity, through an innovative Web-based planning tool. The changes introduced have led to significant advantages and improvement for the manufacturing company, in terms of: (i) impressive cost reduction; (ii) better products quality control; (iii) real-time detection and reaction to supply chain issues; (iv) significant reduction of the time spent in planning activity; and (v) resources employment optimization, thanks to the minimization of unproductive setup times on production lines. These two renovation phases represent a basis for possible future developments, such us the integration of sensor-based data on the operational status of production machines and the currently available warehouse supplies. In conclusion, the Industry 4.0-based on-going digitization process guided by things2i allows to continuously collect heterogeneous Human-to-Things (H2T) data, which can be used to optimize the partner manufacturing company as a whole entity."

Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in the twenty-first century global supply chain design, operations and performance. Michael Burkett, managing vice president at Gartner, said: “It’s important to put IoT maturity into perspective, because of the fast pace at which it is emerging, so supply chain strategists need to be looking at its potential now. Supply chain leaders must design their processes to operate in this digital business world”. This includes fulfilling the new expectations of customers and the volatile demands that digital marketing will create. A future supply chain will meet those expectations by converging people, business and things in a digital value network, and incorporating fast-emerging capabilities such as IoT and smart machines into this design strategy[1]. The evolution and changes in ICT are inevitable due to emerging organizational performance objectives and the role of ICT. These include changes in connectivity and access from standalone computing to pervasive ubiquitous computing, wired to wireless connectivity, 24×7 information availability in smart devices, interactive and customizable social network web pages, abundance instant information and self-organizing networks. In terms of decision making, access to the required information is very limited earlier because of the existence of complex models and limited resources to find solutions. However, the recent scenario is exactly opposite with plethora of information and excess resources such as super-computing power with each individuals to deal with complex models. Manpower requirements are also changing from programming to content development and customizing exiting tool with their own creativity. The above changes in connectivity, access, decision making and skilled human power have substantial impact of Information Technology (IT) governance. Success of global IoT supply chain networks depends on how they govern the IT changes and make use of the ICT potential to achieve the latent values in terms of supporting organizational competitiveness.

Stakeholders need to find out different ways to communicate information and coordinate material flows during the supply chain processes. Many recent studies have advanced construction supply chain coordination from multiple perspectives. However, the field still lacks a comprehensive analysis to summarize existing research, to explicitly identify all the possible enablers for coordination and to investigate how the enablers can be carried out at the supply chain interfaces. To fill the gap, this study aims to conduct a systematic review in order to examine the relevant literature. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review process was conducted to identify and synthesize relevant publications (published in the past 20 years) concerning the coordination of construction supply chain functions. These publications were coded to link main research findings with specific enabler categories. In addition, how these enablers can be used at the interfaces across supply chain processes was reviewed with an in-depth analysis of reciprocal communications between stakeholders at design-to-production, production-to-logistics and production-to-site-assembly phases. Findings: The coordination enablers were classified into three categories: (1) contractual enablers (including subtopics on relational contracts and incentive models), (2) procedural enablers (including subtopics on multiagent knowledge sharing systems and the last planner system) and (3) technological enablers (including subtopics on linked databases for design coordination, design for manufacturing software platforms and automated monitoring technologies). It was found that interfacing different functions requires a certain level of integration of stakeholders for quick response and feedback processes. The integration of novel contractual forms with digital technologies, such as smart contracts, however, was not adequately addressed in the state of the art. Research limitations/implications: The scope of the systematic review is limited to the static analysis of selected publications. Longitudinal studies should be further included to sharpen the inductions of enablers considering organizational changes and process dynamics in construction projects. Practical implications: Different enablers for coordination were summarized in a concise manner, which provides researchers and project stakeholders with a reinforced understanding of various ways to manage reciprocal interdependencies at different supply chain interfaces. Originality/value: This study constitutes an important input for research on the construction supply chain by illuminating the thematic topic of coordination from inductively developed review processes, which included a holistic framing of the emerging coordination enablers and their use across supply chain functions. Consequently, it closes some identified knowledge gaps and offers additional insights to improve the supply chain performance of construction projects."

The capability of DDM to improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain reconfiguration. Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus, using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities faster."

The approach consists of two main steps that contractors should take: 1) monitor the demand fluctuations based on a 4D model that captures the as-built status and updated look-ahead schedules, 2) make decisions to modify original orders to accommodate the demand fluctuations where orders are determined by a heuristic evolutionary algorithm. As a proof of concept, the coordination approach is demonstrated using an example project featuring a five-day in-situ construction of concrete walls. Results from this example show that using the approach improves the responsiveness of concrete planning and ordering. As a result, this leads to improved collaboration between suppliers and contractors in construction projects."

The logistics processes in their current shape will undergo a significant change. Therefore, based on a widespread discussion that has been recently taking place in the environment of scientists, politicians, local government officials and management practitioners, the question once again arises about the level of preparation of enterprises for functioning in this specific environment. Aiming to fill the existing gap in knowledge, a series of studies was conducted, the main purpose of which was to recognize key competences from the point of view of existence in the conditions triggered by the COVID-19 crisis. Considering the empirical evidence confirming the existence of a strong relationship between company stability and an effective supply chain, the following research direction aggregates logistic microfoundations to the attribute of a ""mature"" enterprise. Methods: Referring to the outlined objective, using the method of reconstruction and interpretation of the literature on the subject, it was recommended to nominate questions assessing the level of maturity of logistics subsystems (theoretical layer) as a necessary action. At the conceptual (design) level, it was crucial to compile the research tool being the resultant of the related literature exploration (theoretical model) and discussion among deliberately selected experts (""virtual"" brainstorming). At the empirical level, this enabled the recognition of competences that determine the survival of enterprises in crisis conditions, and thus allowed the development of recommendations for managers of manufacturing enterprises. Results: The paper proposes a procedure and a tool to identify key capabilities that determine the survival of enterprises in COVID-19 crisis conditions. The brainstorming research model reflects the areas of digital technology that the manufacturers, in the context of the current pandemic, should absorb (coincidence). Moreover, it was established that the process of economic recovery will take place in cooperation with enterprises absorbing the logistic management model based on digital technologies. To sum up, it should be noted that the maturity of such an enterprise is manifested in the use of descriptions defined in the research, not only in terms of production, but also in the entire supply chain. All these activities need to be harmonized, creating a crisis-proof enterprise. The organization of such an enterprise is characterized by delegating as many tasks as possible to competent employees who, using the knowledge and available digital technologies, add value throughout the entire chain. Conclusions: The results of the research confirmed the author's belief that on the one hand digital technologies imply the possibility of surviving in the face of the crisis caused by COVID-19 (continuity of the supply chain, remote work without participation, or with limited human participation, etc.), on the other, implemented by enterprises, can be a kind of ""protective shield"" against the negative effects of a pandemic; from the perspective of the issue taken in the research work, they determine the maturity of the company's logistics subsystems. It seems that relatively small scientific recognition and complexity of problems occurring in business practice justify treating the COVID-19 issue as the subject of research, which is reflected in this publication."

Three different supply chain models are analyzed: manufacturer Stackelberg, retailer Stackelberg and vertical integration. We show that the retailer's utility function has no effect on the equilibrium strategies, and suggest schemes to find these strategies for any utility function of the manufacturer. Further results are obtained under assumptions of either a multiplicative or an additive demand model. We study the players' strategies under different profit criteria reflecting different attitudes toward risk - specifically, the Expectation criterion and the Target criterion - and, for each criterion, we obtain the dependence between the pricing and the protection investment. We show that there are situations in which the manufacturer can increase his profit by giving up his leadership to the retailer, even if the power balance is in his favor."

However, the existence centralized outcome has endured with confined data storage and lack of trust during the involvement of multiple parties. In order to overcome these issues, an approach of decentralized block chain is required by generating digital representation for physical goods to promote tracking over several entities. There are several existing challenges which involve lack in transparency, lack in traceability, complex in risk management, disruption, requirement for creating reputation and trust. Hence, one of the leading technologies is block chain which has the potential in resolving few coordination challenges in SCM by smart contract for handling the multiple exchanges between parties. Block chain technology has reduced the complexity, better transparency and verification of trustless oversupply chain. These can be done through smart contracts which provide a digital agreement among the transaction parties using ethereum during assist of writing computer code and even implemented in block chain that makes the client to self-execute while they are accommodated with predetermined situation. Thus, it helps for accelerating the supply chain which made more agile and foster strengthens relationship among partners.

Front-end technologies consider four dimensions: Smart Manufacturing, Smart Products, Smart Supply Chain and Smart Working, while base technologies consider four elements: internet of things, cloud services, big data and analytics. We performed a survey in 92 manufacturing companies to study the implementation of these technologies. Our findings show that Industry 4.0 is related to a systemic adoption of the front-end technologies, in which Smart Manufacturing plays a central role.

Increasingly, it is pointed out that digital technology has some distinct features that have fundamental implications for innovation. The aim of the present study is to determine the impact of the risk of implementing digital technologies for logistics management. The study was conducted using the standardized questionnaire interview method with representatives of the management of enterprises. The attempt was random. The sampling was made up of micro, small, medium, and large enterprises from the production and services sectors, having a logistics unit or a logistics division, located in the ""Bisnode Poland"" database. In total, 360 full interviews were carried out. For the study, we defined macro-environment, operational, functional, and microenvironment risks. The basic conclusion is that between each type of risk and the type of digital technologies used in the studied entities and their partners in the supply chain, there is a high and very high dependence in the case of three-dimensional printing (3D printing), artificial intelligence, blockchain, drones, augmented reality, and self-propelled vehicles."

This innovation is consistent with the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals of transforming world economies toward a more sustainable future vision by reducing poverty and inequality. As our contribution, we adopt a traditional approach in our perspective article to initiate a scholarly curiosity to discuss and develop research needs on how to use technology to address this current and critical sustainability and supply chain concern. Blockchain can solve the inefficiencies, complexities, and other social issues of smallholder farmers in the supply chain. This article identifies some blockchain technologies in emerging economies, such as Hara Technology in Indonesia and Cellulant Agrikore Blockchain Solution in Nigeria. Again, we observed that the promise of using technology to improve smallholders' vulnerability in the cocoa supply chain remains underexploited in Africa and other emerging economies. Therefore, rigorous research on smallholders' social sustainability is needed to make sound policy recommendations. This short perspective article describes issues facing these smallholder farmers and how technology can play a role for them and their supply chains to alleviate various social and environmental concerns. Accordingly, we propose some research questions for technology, innovation, and engineering management researchers."

Findings: Blockchain improves the efficiency of the process: it reduces the number of operations, reduces the average time of orders in the system, reduces workload, shows traceability of orders and improves visibility to various supply chain participants. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a single in-depth case that has the scope to be tested in other contexts in future. Practical implications: This is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, reduction on the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided. Furthermore, this research shows a list of the resources and capabilities needed for building and maintaining a Blockchain in the context of supply chains. Originality/value: This is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, the reduction in the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided. This paper contributes to the resource-based view of the firm, by demonstrating two new competitive valuable capabilities and a new dynamic capability that organisations develop when implementing and using Blockchain in a supply–demand process. It also contributes to the information processing theory by highlighting the analytics capabilities required to sustain Blockchain-related operations."

Virtualization requires technical innovation using IoT technologies such as smart sensors, and it allows to transmit quality information across the chain. Associated organizational innovation is complex, especially in SME-dominated supply chains, and relies upon intensive knowledge exchange, discussions and negotiation. However, the development of solutions to address socio-institutional barriers to virtual supply chains has been under-researched up to now. This study analyses barriers to virtualization faced in SME-dominated supply chains, that is, the Dutch floriculture. The second step is developing a solution to core barriers in the form of a dedicated simulation game, the ‘Virtual Flower Chain’. Design and experiences are shown. The barriers that the game addresses are a sector-wide lack of cooperation, consumer focus, and sense of urgency, as well as a limited understanding of virtualization. The validation through game sessions shows that 87% of the participants gained more insights about the benefits of virtualization technologies and the willingness to collaborate, rather than blaming others, increased to 89% after the game. Game participants achieved more awareness of their position in a larger system, rather than as an isolated business."

Webinars are digital tools to deliver training and education through synchronous audiovisual communication among remotely located training instructors and participants. A webinar is a special case of web conferencing that serves the educational function of learning and teaching. Because the previous literature underemphasized the webinar process and qualitative learner experiences, the present study aimed to explore the reactions of 419 trainees toward 48 webinars in the four content areas supply chain management, industrial management, early childhood education and mathematics, the present study used a sequential mixed methods research design. The quantitative part of the study employed a multi-item online questionnaire to measure satisfaction and reactions toward the webinar trainer; survey responses were analyzed to estimate mean differences across webinars. The qualitative part of the study employed narrative interviews with 23 trainees; interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis to identify how the instructional design, webinar content and implementation can be improved for future web conferences. The findings indicate that early childhood education trainees had the highest satisfaction levels. Trainees preferred greater levels of learner-teacher interaction, less time spent on discussing task solutions collaboratively and digital webinar recordings as a follow-up possibility at home or in the workplace. Trainees also liked the fact that webinars afforded the possibility to deepen the content, to prepare for upcoming exams and to have virtual consultation hours with the facilitator. Furthermore, trainees preferred webinars no longer than 90 min and webinars on weekdays after work rather than at weekends. Optimal internet/broadband connections were perceived as a requirement across web conferencing and virtual classroom programs for effective digital education. Implications of the findings for educational technology, human resource development and professional learning are discussed."

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a sequential mixed-method. First, a Delphi study was designed to gain insights regarding the terminology of big data and to identify and rank applications of big data in SCM using an adjusted supply chain operations reference (SCOR) process framework.

Digital control systems are becoming ubiquitous in complex products, and these digital innovations integrate other components across a product structure and introduce a level of indeterminacy and unpredictability in the organization of the interfirm division of innovative labor. Much of organizational scholarship holds that accompanying a shift toward increasingly modular product structures, component suppliers are engaging in relatively more design and invention around the components that they supply. We find that the evolution of digital controls may reverse this pattern, because in the wake of a major shift in the digital controls technology, suppliers actually engage in relatively less component innovation in comparison with their large manufacturing customers. To explain this shift, we characterize complex product structures in terms of two distinct product hierarchies: the inclusionary and the digital control hierarchy. In using this distinction to analyze the evolution of automotive emission control systems from 1970 to 1998, we reconcile two competing views about the interfirm division of innovative labor."

In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions.

It is necessary to power up a chip at a distributor's site to measure different electrical parameters for verifying whether it is used before. However, this can be challenging, as many of the distributors may not be equipped with proper test infrastructures. Moreover, the reliability of authentic chips may be reduced if they have been removed from the packaging boxes for testing purposes. In this paper, we propose a robust and low-cost solution for enabling the traceability of an IC. The proposed solution builds a chain of trust among the manufacturer, distributors, and system integrator by enabling end-to-end traceability from manufacturing to system integration and provides protection against IC recycling. The proposed solution utilizes a small passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, which needs to be placed on the package.

It is necessary to build smart supply chains according to this concept. A network of component enterprises in a supply chain would be modeled as a virtual supply chain in the cyber world. From the viewpoint of Industry 4.0, virtualizing a supply chain is the foundation for constructing a CPS for a supply chain. The virtualization of a supply chain makes it easier for companies to study their integrating and expanding opportunities. By using this CPS, comprehensive and autonomous optimization of the supply chain can be achieved. This virtual supply chain can be used to sim-ulate the planning phase with negotiation, as well as the production phase. In this paper, instead of specific mathematical modeling for each supply chain, a gen-eral configuration method of a virtual supply chain is proposed. The configuration method of a supply chain model is proposed as a virtual supply chain using enterprise e-catalogues. A virtual supply chain is constructed as a multi-agent system, which is connections of software agents that are automatically created from each selected enterprise model in the e-catalogues. Three types of component enterprise models are pro-vided: manufacturer model, part/material supplier model, and retailer model. Modeling templates for these three types of enterprises are prepared, and each template is a nominal model in terms of enterprise’s behavior. Specific component-enterprise models are prepared by filling the appropriate template. Each component enterprise agent is implemented using the enterprise model selected from the catalogues. Manu-facturer, retailer, and supplier e-catalogues, as well as an automatic construction system of a virtual supply chain, are implemented. Methods for developing templates for the manufacturer, retailer and supplier were provided, and the construction system for specific enterprise models (as e-catalogues) is implemented as a trial."

While developing digital services, however, banks are also concerned that they are losing contact with their customers. At the same time, fast developing technologies enable new companies to enter the industry to offer their services. As a result, the service supply chains in the banking industry appear to be restructured. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical data were collected by using a qualitative method of focus groups and interviews with end-users of banking services. Findings: According to findings, customers value a holistic approach to the services, and such a holistic value cannot necessarily be provided by a single banking service provider because the ecosystem around such services is becoming more complex. Practical implications: Service supply chains need to be restructured based on the end-customer value experience. Originality/value: This study contributes to value research and especially to the discussion in service experiences by addressing some of the disruptions happening at the industry level.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative survey design was used to investigate the areas, patterns and elements for implementing FoF. A total of 92 responses from manufacturing firms of Alpine regions were collected and analysed, followed by in-depth interviews with a subset of respondents to identify common challenges, drivers and opportunities for the transformation. Findings: Manufacturing companies are gaining awareness on their needs and gaps in the FoF path, the implications on business strategy and the rates of innovation and technology adoption. Nevertheless, they still need to shape their organisational structures (e.g. from highly centralised to more collaborative ones) and nurture their managerial capabilities in operations and supply chain management, and customer relationships, only partially based on FoF technologies. Research limitations/implications: This study aims to contribute to recent literature and practice of FoF (and related concepts) by depicting a picture of the possible areas of intervention, main issues and gaps (especially in terms of skills, supply chain and customer relationships) of manufacturing companies in their digital transformation. The qualitative research design and its scope represent the main limitations. Originality/value: This paper provides a systemic overview for FoF by encompassing the technological, strategic, managerial and organisational perspectives of digitalisation in manufacturing and integrating the insights from a multi-sectorial and multi-dimensional analysis."

This model is used for a company to assess current practices of procurement function and perceives the level of its capabilities. The data collection is from a survey of fifty two selected procurement organizations in Southeast Asia (SEA) countries; from Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the significant value of industry type, size of spending and centralized decentralized procurement that affect procurement capability maturity. The results show that the industry has no relation to the capability maturity; the size of procurement spend has a positive relation to the capability maturity; and the centralized procurement has higher capability maturity than the decentralized. Moreover, this study extends the knowledge of e-Procurement and digital context to leverage procurement processes and visible procurement integration in an organization and across the supply chain.

This reinforces the importance of the contract design problem between the virtual product supplier (he) and the digital platform retailer (she). The purpose of this paper is to investigate a principal-agent problem in a virtual product supply chain, in which the retailer’s sales-effort investment level to sell the virtual product is unobservable to the supplier, and the market demand is unknown to both parties. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the supplier designs two kinds of contracts (wholesale price contract and two-part tariff contract) to maximize his profit, while the retailer determines her sales-effort investment level and the virtual product’s retail price. The results of two different types of contracts are compared to explore in depth the effect of contract choices on the participants’ profits. Findings: The authors show that the comparative results of the optimal wholesale prices, retail prices and sales-effort investment levels between these two kinds of contracts all rely on the retailer’s risk-averse degree. Specifically, both the supplier and the whole supply chain prefer the two-part tariff contract rather than the wholesale price contract, the retailer should do opposite when she is low risk-averse, whereas there is no distinction for the retailer’s utilities between these two kinds of contracts when she is more risk-averse. Originality/value: The value of the research rests on the use of principal-agent theory in the contracts of virtual products considering the retailer’s sales-effort and risk-aversion degree. The research will serve as a guide for the virtual products’ supplier and the platform retailer in decision-making processes."

Since the start of the fourth industrial revolution, the digital tools allow productivity improvement. Different kinds of technologies have been used to support companies in tasks of sending and receiving information. The information exchanged between companies has always being a concern when having in mind trust, speed, and safety. During few decades, EDI (electronic data exchange) was the main technology supply chain professionals used to send and receive information. Recently, with the rise of the fourth industrial revolution and the Internet of Things (IoT), many aspects of the business environment have changed. Individuals and organizations are required to be more productive. One of the mainstreams for the business environment is blockchain. Some researches argued that bitcoin is the pioneer of blockchain technology. Financial companies joined forces to build a technological infrastructure to use the cryptocurrency on the market. The first blockchain conceived in 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis and it has never been hacked. Supply chains are complex networks of distant, separate entities that exchange goods, payments, and data across a dynamic, continuously evolving landscape. Blockchain technology allows visibility providing the customer the opportunity to understand how the supply chain works and how to get more information about products traceability. However, there are some challenges to implement blockchain in logistic and supply chain. The paper presents a theoretical review including the principles of the blockchain operations and the required infrastructure to implement it. The paper does not cover the technology architecture applied to the blockchain. The potential benefit of the blockchain will be covered to understand how to apply it in logistics and in the supply chain environment, presenting some examples already implemented or identified."

As part of this process, committee members requested and received feedback on how they might clarify the recommendations made within the policy statement.This edition of the statement seeks to address these issues. It is important to note that most of the problems discovered by BISG’s Identification Committee surrounding the misapplication of ISBNs todigital contentresulted from a lack of communication. In many cases, trading partners admitted to taking whatever information was given them and doingwhatever manual manipulation was needed to get a job done,thenmoving on. In an environment as complex and evolving as the digital supply chain, this is obviously not ideal. Regardless of the specific recommendations outlined here, perhaps the most important item to stress is the need for direct communication among trading partners"

Design/methodology/approach - Brian Arthur's theory of combinatorial technological evolution is applied to examine possible digital manufacturing-driven transformations. The F-18 Super Hornet is used as an illustrative example of a service supply chain for a complex product. Findings - The introduction of digital manufacturing will likely result in hybrid solutions, combining conventional logistics, digital manufacturing and user operations. Direct benefits can be identified in the forms of life cycle extension and the increased availability of parts in challenging locations. Furthermore, there are also opportunities for both equipment manufacturers and LSPs to adopt new roles, thereby supporting the efficient and sustainable use of digital manufacturing. Research limitations/implications - The phenomenon of digital manufacturing-driven transformations of service supply chains for complex product does not yet fully exist in the real world, and its study requires cross-disciplinary collaboration. Thus, the implication for research is to use a design science approach for early-stage explorative research on the form and function of novel combinations. Practical implications - Digital manufacturing as a general-purpose technology gives LSPs an opportunity to consolidate demand from initial users and incrementally deploy capacity closer to new users.

The research shows overall supply chain inefficiency is attributable to procurement-stock conversion inefficiency. From a view of operations model, the third-party platform model is more efficient than a “shop in shop” self-operated model. However, the self-operated mode performs better in product categories such as computer & Office & digital, food & drink and healthy products due to these products’ delivery characteristics and consumers’ shopping habits. In the logistics selection, most e-retail players are inclined to choose the hybrid model of 3PL and self-operated logistics with the product category extension from vertical model to all-category model.

Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) applications can potentially fulfil this need by providing a digital Product Model that informs designers about manufacturability aspects and expected performance. This paper explores the currently available digital tools, as well as KBE and its applicability in façade design. It is first demonstrated that there is a fundamental gap in state-of-the-art digital tools: rather than integrating design principles and manufacturing constraints, existing and emerging tools continue to focus on single disciplines with no consideration for the actual manufacturing stage. The applicability of KBE is then evaluated by reviewing the current use of this approach in the building and other industries, namely, aerospace and shipbuilding. It is found that, although KBE is rarely used in façade design, there are significant opportunities for it to be applied in this sector, due to the similarity in terms of design tasks and priorities with the two other industries reviewed in this paper."

An important element of building a competitive advantage of small and medium-sized enterprises may be the implementation of a model for their digital transformation as an element of a wider concept of digital supply chains. Methods: The article uses the method of ""case study"" and questionnaire research to develop a model of digital transformation of enterprises from the SME sector. It is worth pointing out that small and medium-sized enterprises are the most numerous group of institutional participants in the modern market economy. The work uses the concept of the Digitization Index and quality tools, which include, inter alia, Ishikawa diagram and SWOT analysis. The research environment was a manufacturing company from the furniture industry, also acting as the main coordinator between all the links with which it cooperates within the supply chain Results: The article describes the phenomena of digital transformation, which is the main driving force of the digital economy and digitization, which is an indispensable element of transforming business models in accordance with its principles. The final effect of digital transformation of supply chains, which is the creation of new business models based on the properties of digital solutions, called digital supply chains, was also characterized. As a result of the considerations, a concept for building a digital transformation model for enterprises in the SME sector was proposed. Conclusions: The model of digital transformation of enterprises in the SME sector should include both the assessment of the current level of digitization of the enterprise as well as the proposal of its digital transformation. Increasing the degree of digitization of the enterprise surveyed as part of the case study will allow, in the long run, to achieve an increase in the effectiveness of the tasks performed, mainly in terms of reducing the time of their execution and improving the efficiency of information flow between all participants in the supply chain. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska."

In this manuscript, we describe how data encryption and digital signature algorithms can be used to ensure the integrity and authenticity of synthetic genetic constructs. Using a pilot software that generates digital signatures and other encrypted data for plasmids, we demonstrate that we can predictably extract information about the author, the identity, the integrity of plasmid sequences, and even annotations from sequencing data alone without a reference sequence, all without compromising the function of the plasmids. Encoding a digital signature into a DNA molecule provides an avenue for genetic designers to claim authorship of DNA molecules.

However, the distribution of these digital goods in conjunction with their physical analogs (i.e., printed books) has been operationally problematic for media supply chains. Specifically, the types of contracts utilized to distribute these goods such as agency models have come under fire in the press. A high profile case brought by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against Apple exemplifies this debate as the DOJ claims that the agency model utilized by Apple caused higher prices and decreased consumer surplus. We create and analyze a model of vertically differentiated goods to compare and contrast the agency model with the wholesale model. We ascertain that both (a) the revenue-sharing structure and (b) the upstream publisher's control over the price contribute to the benefits of the agency model. We consider a variation of this model which shows that if the retailer utilizes a “fixed price” model, then he suffers from a short-term loss in profit, possibly to garner additional market share. We also investigate an incentive alignment condition for the agency model which assures that the retailer and the publisher will together commit to selling digital goods alongside physical goods in the supply chain. Finally, we analyze an extension of the original model which incorporates horizontal differentiation in addition to vertical differentiation and shows that in most cases, the horizontal differentiation does not alter our original results that the agency model outperforms the wholesale model."

Thus, AM based practices that can reduce supply chain costs gain in importance. We take a forward-looking approach and study how AM can be used more effectively in the production of multi-part products in low to medium quantities. The impact of introducing kitting in AM on supply chain cost is investigated. Kitting approaches are traditionally devised to feed all components belonging to an assembly into individual containers. Where conventional manufacturing approaches are used for kitting, the produced parts pass through inventory and kit preparation steps before being forwarded to the assembly line/station. However, by taking advantage of the object-oriented information handling inherent in the AM process, kitting information can be embedded directly within the digital design data and parts produced in a common build. This model-based kitting practice reduces − even eliminates − the need for a manual kit preparation step and promises additional supply chain benefits. Eight experiments were conducted using laser sintering (LS) to investigate the impact of model-based component kitting on production cost and supply chain cost. The results show that with current state-of-the-art volume packing software, production costs increase with the adoption of kitting. The increased production cost was off-set to different extents by kitting supply chain benefits, including simplified production planning, reduced work-in-progress inventory and elimination of parts fetching prior to assembly. Findings of this research are of interest for manufacturers, service bureaus and practitioners who use AM for low quantity production, as well as developers of AM volume packing and production planning software."

A critical element will be the evolution of traditional supply chains toward a connected, smart, and highly efficient supply chain ecosystem. The supply chain today is a series of largely discrete, siloed steps taken through marketing, product development, manufacturing, and distribution, and finally into the hands of the customer. Digitization brings down those walls, and the chain becomes a completely integrated ecosystem that is fully transparent to all the players involved — from the suppliers of raw materials, components, and parts, to the transporters of those supplies and finished goods, and finally to the customers demanding fulfillment. This network will depend on a number of key technologies: integrated planning and execution systems, logistics visibility, autonomous logistics, smart procurement and warehousing, spare parts management, and advanced analytics. The result will enable companies to react to disruptions in the supply chain, and even anticipate them, by fully modeling the network, creating “what-if” scenarios, and adjusting the supply chain in real time as conditions change. Once built — and the components are starting to be developed today — the digital supply “network” will offer a new degree of resiliency and responsiveness enabling companies that get there first to beat the competition in the effort to provide customers with the most efficient and transparent service delivery. 4"

This study proposes a revenue-sharing mechanism in which the relationships among the film distributor, traditional DVD rental store, and Internet VOD service provider are investigated to avoid channel conflicts and achieve effective supply chain coordination. We assume that the services provided by the two channels are substitutable for consumers, and consider that both the diffusion effect and piracy rate are essential in order to forecast the demand for motion pictures. A game theoretic model is constructed to obtain the optimal revenue sharing ratio and the equilibrium retail prices for the two channels, with the aim of enhancing overall supply chain performance and profitability. The results show that when piracy is considered in the market, the market potentials of the two channels would decrease, and the price elasticity would increase, so the members of the supply chain in the film industry have to pay more attention to the impacts of cross elasticity, and be more prudent when determining their pricing strategies."

Most of these developments have the same root cause: a shift in product development from the time-worn focus on physical products to a comprehensive consideration of actual patient needs. While this sounds very simple, it has to be understood in the context of an industry where the patients as the end customers traditionally have been neither in direct contact with producers nor able to make buying decisions regarding complex drugs on their own. However, innovative (sometimes even individualized) drugs and new information technologies require and enable new information flows and affect traditional supply chain configurations. Industry dynamics are currently driven by the emergence of biosimilars, therapeutically differentiated drugs, increasingly complex transportation requirements, new possibilities for patient compliance monitoring, and digital transformation of supply chain business processes. This series of five articles sheds light on current industry developments and their rationales, and elaborates on their implications for various supply chain components. This first installment in the series emphasizes trends and paradigm shifts in supply chain management that can be observed now. A range of perspectives providing detailed descriptions will be found in subsequent articles and enriched by short case studies illustrating, e.g., regional particularities, future value-added services, postponement strategies, and supply chain segmentation approaches."

However, academic research in this area is sparse. This study develops and tests a theoretical framework of the moderating effect of virtual integration on interorganziational governance in international customer supplier relationships. Design/methodology/approach: We chose to examine the specific cross-border relationships between Taiwanese suppliers and their international OEMs because Taiwanese suppliers tend to be smaller than their international OEM customers, and thus their relationships usually show power asymmetry. Furthermore, the Taiwanese electronics industry offers a valuable empirical context because its industry members have served as pioneers in information technology development, have championed cross-border relationships with US and European industry leaders and are actively participating in the world economy Findings: Our empirical findings indicate that virtual integration will strengthen the effect contractual governance on relationship performance. However, the moderating effect of virtual integration on relational governance is not significant. The paper discusses the theoretical and managerial implications in the end. Originality/value: This study contributes to interorganizational governance literature in international contexts. Previous work on international relationship management has focused much on MNE buyers' perspectives and paid little attention to the suppliers' perspectives. This study extends this stream of research by empirically examining how suppliers can govern their MNEs' customers via different governance mechanisms. The findings extend literature on virtual integration and show that virtual integration can complement detailed contract and safeguard opportunism, which in turn, enhance relationship performance in international customer–supplier relationships."

The article uses the value chain concept as the framework to examine changes in audience consumption habits and to explore emerging business practice, as a result of new technology. The article argues that film distribution is shifting from a supply-led to a demand-led market. In this way, independent distributors can now break away from the rigid singular value chain that dominated the industry, and adopt bespoke release strategies that are tailored to the individual needs of each film. This arguably marks the beginning of a fundamental shift in the relationship between key segments in the film value chain by allowing independent distributors to create a more attractive product by conducting their business in response to consumer demands, as opposed to rigid market-driven conditions."

The purpose of this paper is to understand the capabilities that enable healthcare resilience and how digital technologies can support these capabilities. Design/methodology/approach: Within- and cross-case research methodology was used to study resilience mechanisms and capabilities in healthcare and to understand how digital health technologies impact healthcare resilience. The authors analyze data from two Italian hospitals through the lens of the operational failure literature and anchor the findings to the theory of dynamic capabilities. Findings: Five different dynamic capabilities emerged as crucial for managing operational failure. Furthermore, in relation to these capabilities, medical, organizational and patient-related knowledge surfaced as major enablers. Finally, the findings allowed the authors to better explain the role of knowledge in healthcare resilience and how digital technologies boost this role. Practical implications: When trying to promote a culture of patient safety, the research suggests healthcare managers should focus on promoting and enhancing resilience capabilities. Furthermore, when evaluating the role of digital technologies, healthcare managers should consider their importance in enabling these dynamic capabilities. Originality/value: Although operations management (OM) research points to resilience as a crucial behavior in the supply chain, this is the first research that investigates the concept of resilience in healthcare systems from an OM perspective, with only a few authors having studied similar concepts, such as “workaround” practices."

This study proposes an integrated agent system, called SPA, which coordinates simulated and physical agents to provide an efficient way for organizations to meet the challenges in managing supply chains. In the integrated framework, physical agents coordinate with inter-organizations' physical agents to form workable business processes and detect the variations occurring in the outside world, whereas simulated agents model and analyze the what-if scenarios to support physical agents in making decisions. This study uses a supply chain that produces digital still cameras as an example to demonstrate how the SPA works. In this example, individual information systems of the involved companies equip with the SPA and the entire supply chain is modeled as a hierarchical object oriented Petri nets. The SPA here applies the modified AGNES data clustering technique and the moving average approach to help each firm generalize customers' past demand patterns and forecast their future demands. The amplitude of forecasting errors caused by bullwhip effects is used as a metric to evaluate the degree that the SPA affects the supply chain performance. The experimental results show that the SPA benefits the entire supply chain by reducing the bullwhip effects and forecasting errors in a dynamic environment. © Copyright JASSS."

Given the highly competitive market scenario, supply chain management is becoming the most important functional area of the business. Demand forecasting is affecting the success of Supply Chain Management (SCM), and the organizations which support them and are in the early stage of a digital transformation.

Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the ""ownership, economic value, use and access of data"" and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity).

Digital technologies overcome information problems that hinder market access for many small-scale farmers, increase knowledge through new ways of providing extension services, and they provide novel ways for improving agricultural supply chain management. While there are many promising examples of positive impacts on rural livelihoods—or “digital dividends”—these have often not scaled up to the extent expected. The main reason is that technology can always only address some, but not all of the barriers faced by farmers in poorer countries."

The ability of AI to automate, augment and enhance customer experience and decision-making as well as reinvent business strategies makes AI the most current general purpose technology compared to other disruptive technologies of today. While many businesses have already implemented AI tools in supply chain management, others are struggling with ‘How to use AI?’ in the implementation stage and ‘What are the options available?’ in the capacity to pick the most apt solution. This report commissioned by Innovate UK aims to understand how AI can be used in transforming supply chains of companies.

The recent rise of this trend has led the authors to investigate this new class of machines in novel settings, including hub configuration. There are various supply chain configurations to supply spare parts in industrial operations. This paper aims to explore the promise of a production configuration that combines the benefits of centralized production with the flexibility of local manufacturing without the huge costs related to it. Design/methodology/approach: This study quantitatively examines the feasibility of different AM-enabled spare parts supply chain configurations. Using cost data extracted from a case study, three scenarios per AM machine technology are modeled and compared. Findings: Results suggest that hub production configuration depending on the utilized AM machines can provide economic efficiency and effectiveness to reduce equipment downtime. While previous studies have suggested the need for AM machines with efficiency for single part production for a distributed supply chain, the findings in this research illustrate the positive relationship between multi-part production capability and the feasibility of a hub manufacturing configuration establishment. Originality/value: This study explores the promise of a production configuration that combines the benefits of centralized production with the flexibility of local manufacturing without the huge costs related to it. Although the existing body of knowledge contains research on production decentralization, research on various levels of decentralization is lacking. Using a real-world case study, this study aims to compare the feasibility of different levels of decentralization for AM-enabled spare parts supply chains."

Nevertheless, while the industry has been distracted with tools like Self-Service checkouts and specific Buy Online Collect In-store so as to make things quicker, ultimately an Online Retailer has come up with a resolution that none other thought about – NO Checkout.It is a known fact that, waiting in serpentine lines for checkout is one of the least favorite parts of the experience of grocery shopping for the customer. And notwithstanding the improvement in automated technology towards making the checkout experience quicker and simpler, it is still considered as the prime reason people dread going to a store.Amazon deems that it has given a solution to the problem by introducing Amazon Go which is the new checkout-free convenience store that gives a currently unmatched in store-based retail experience. The experience is intended for the people who are averse of standing in checkout lines. It has a simple premise – the Amazon Go mobile app is scanned by the customers when they enter the store, take the items required from the shelves and directly walk out of the door. All the hassles like checkouts, card transactions, bagging are set to be eliminated for the Amazon Go shoppers.The opening of Amazon Go stores is an indication of one more impending disruption that grocers are facing from the world’s largest online retailer. Serpentine lines can be a deterrent for shoppers hence an organization that works out a means of eradicating wait time will surely gain an advantage."

Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems."

Methods: The BRUINchain system requirements include scanning the drug package for a correctly formatted 2D barcode, flagging expired product, verifying the product with the manufacturer, and quarantining suspect and illegitimate products at the last mile: pharmacist to patient, the most complex area of the drug supply chain. The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States. Results: In addition to communicating with the manufacturer directly for verification, BRUINchain also initiated suspect product notifications. During the study, a 100% success rate was observed across scanning, expiration detection, and counterfeit detection; and paperwork reduction from approximately 1 hour to less than a minute. The authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States.   Conclusions: By automatically interrogating the manufacturer’s relational database with our blockchain-based system, our results indicate a projected DSCSA compliance cost of 17 cents per unit, and potentially much more depending on regulatory interpretation and speed of verification. We project that this cost could be reduced with manufacturers’ adoption of a highly performant, fully automated end-to-end system based on digital ledger technology (DLT). In an examination of the interoperability of such a system, we elaborate on its capacity to enable verification in real time without a human in the loop, the key feature driving lower compliance cost. With 4.2 billion prescriptions being dispensed each year in the United States, DLT would not only reduce the projected per-unit cost to 13 cents per unit (saving $183 million in annual labor costs), but also serve as a major bulwark against bad or fraudulent transactions, reduce the need for safety stock, and enhance the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers."

The design of more sustainable logistics business types can address such challenges to build more resilient supply chains. Therefore, the discussion with regard to transformational potentials of logistics businesses provides valuable information to shape business strategies according to future sustainability requirements. Within the framework of this paper, a mixed-methods approach has been applied to explore and analyze drivers and barriers for sustainability transformations of logistics service providers (LSPs) and to evaluate related business strategies with optimization and simulation methods in a concrete regional context. So far, LSPs’ main obstacles are competitive pressure, focal firm orientation, and dependence on other supply chain members, while supply chain collaboration and integration, as well as the integration of sharing economy solutions and new digital technologies, have been identified as promising for sustainability transitions. Accordingly, this paper suggests a roadmap for the logistics sector while defining retention strategies such as growth, replication, mimicry, and mergence to meet future societal and environmental requirements. By doing so, this study contributes to theory by constructing the Lead Sustainability Service Provider (6PL) business model (arche)type and its role in societal transitions."

This paper investigates the adoption of demand chain management in Australian organizations using cross-sectional qualitative field study. It found that the adoption is limited despite the organizational capabilities and sound digital platforms. Standardization, integration, visibility and control of processes and information, enabled by enterprise systems, are helping the organizations in improving their ability to sense and shape market demand and customer needs, and build agility into their decision making processes. Attempts to synchronise operating and finance cycles and collecting market intelligence and sharing of that across the supply chain are some of the initiatives that have started showing benefits. Adopting the demand chain management initiatives such as establishment of market intelligence mechanism, building agility into decision making processes, sophisticated usage of optimization tools embedded in software solutions, and process frameworks such as Supply Chain Operations Reference are helping organizations to achieve both agility and control simultaneously. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

By analyzing the trends of scientific production to ascertain the interface of both constructs, the purpose of this paper is to identify limitations for Industry 4.0 and CE implementation in Brazil, as well to present an original framework and strategic pathways to overcome limitations for emerging countries. Design/methodology/approach: Supported in the Brazilian case, the authors draw a framework using the structuralism approach to indicate pathways for the strategic positioning of emerging economies that consider their limitation and potential for competitive advantage. By understanding country-related limitations such as social and economic contingencies, the authors conceive a structure of implications for Brazil’s capacity to develop CE in the digital era. Findings: Results show that Brazil has a reasonable, institutional and stable environment, as well as strong regulatory policies for solid waste that can stimulate CE in the country. However, it requires more communication between actors, especially public and private institutions, performing long-range relationships. Also, the country requires consolidation of industrial policies and investments in the remanufacturing process in the supply chain. Likewise, despite Brazil’s ability to take advantage of CE’s benefits, the country presents a huge lack of qualification to fulfill the competences that the digitization process demands. Economically, Brazil has been fighting against an economic crisis since 2014 that has limited general investments, especially in the industrial sector. Industry presents low performance and decreasing GDP participation, which leads to constant overseas production transfer as a consequence of the workforce’s high costs. Research limitations/implications: The authors can affirm that Brazil is far behind developed countries in searching for the capacity to provide CE through technological industrial change. The main problems are related to the lack of articulation of public and private spheres to promote new digital business models. Therefore, the structured framework enables managers and public agents to provide solutions and to properly address supply chain bottlenecks in emerging economies. Originality/value: Exploring the relationship between the concepts of Industry 4.0 and CE through the specific lens of the structuralist method, this work can contribute to the management decision on emerging countries, looking into four important perspectives: political, economic, social and technological."

We study the roles of demand, assortment, IT systems, sourcing, manufacturing, knowledge, warehousing, and transportation, and explore the effects and tradeoffs on various SC performance outcomes, including cost, assets, and responsiveness. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, through literature synthesis, we construct six AM SC mechanisms that can be used in SC design to achieve desired SC outcomes for AM production applications in certain (business) contexts. Second, we identify the disruptive ‘game-changing’ effects of AM for SC stakeholders. This knowledge can be used by other researchers to develop further research.

Supply chains are as important to customers as the product itself. However, customers are not always provided a clear view of the entire supply chain for goods. To remediate this issue, technology in the form of blockchains can be used to tie the history of a product through its associated supply chain. The idea of using blockchain as a tool for supply chain has recently become more prevalent given the publicity of cryp-tocurrencies like bitcoin. Integrating blockchain into supply chain management allows organizations to develop, produce and purchase products and services with increased efficiency and a reduction in fraud. This, in turn, means that consumers and investors can have faith in the goods and services they purchase.

This allows for trans-parency across all levels of a product or service for a producer and supplier. Supply chains are made up of a network of in-dividuals, organizations, technology, resources and activities that spread from the initial creation of a product to delivery. Blockchains are a secure digital ledger that records crypto-currency transactions in a series of blocks. An individual block maintains a timestamp to record the transaction, known as a cryptographic hash. To process these cryptographic hashes, a network of computers works to solve computationally difficult puzzles, and the first participant to solve the problem gets to add their hash to the blockchain and claim credit, or mine cryptocurrency, for processing. Through this process of min-ing, the collection of timestamped blocks is added together to form the blockchain. These blocks are maintained across several computers or nodes. Although several timestamps and transactions occur on a block, the information cannot be altered or removed after it has been added to the blockchain, nor can entries be forged. This allows for a level of transparency and permanency in terms of an information trail."

Retailers need to understand the new phenomenon and how the concept is influencing customer purchasing behavior, especially online shopping. Several types of research had highlighted the importance of logistics service quality in predicting online purchasing behavior. Thus, this study investigates the relationship between the Omni-channel supply chain and logistics service quality in influencing online purchasing behavior. A survey-based approach is used to collect data from consumers about their perceptions.

Enabling the interaction of industrial Internet of Things (IOT) platforms with Blockchain might be challenging because standards are still missing in both these technologies. Moreover, integrating productive assets with distributed data exchange and storage technologies is a kind of activity that needs to take into account various aspects, in particular: interoperability, portability, scalability, and security that need to be guaranteed by design. This paper describes the implementation of a portable, platform-agnostic and secure Blockchain Tokenizer for Industrial IOT trustless applications. The Industrial Blockchain Tokenizer (IBT) is based on an industrial data acquisition unit able to gather data from both modern and legacy machines while also interfacing directly with sensors. Acquired data can be processed locally enabling an edge filtering paradigm and then sent to any Blockchain platform. The system has been designed, implemented and then tested on two supply chain scenarios. Tests demonstrated the system capability to act as a bridge between industrial assets and Blockchain platforms enabling the generation of immutable and trust-less “digital twins” for industrial IOT applications."

Consumers are increasingly using offline stores to obtain in-store demonstration services and then switching to online stores to purchase the product. This behavior is called “showrooming.” This study considers the pricing problem in a dual-channel supply chain with an online retailer and a manufacturer that owns an offline direct sales store. The manufacturer's product has digital attributes that can be evaluated through both online and offline channels, as well as non-digital attributes that can be evaluated only through in-store product demonstration. We investigate the impacts of the demonstration informativeness on online and offline retail pricing decisions under showrooming behavior. Given the demonstration informativeness and other relevant factors, we then compare the outcomes of the manufacturer's strategies on whether to demonstrate and the retailer's strategies on whether to avoid showrooming. We find that showrooming behavior may be beneficial to the manufacturer that owns an offline store and harmful to the online retailer. When the demonstration informativeness level is medium, the manufacturer will be better off choosing the non-demonstration strategy, and the online retailer will select the non-showrooming strategy. We also show that, in comparison to exogenous wholesale prices, when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price endogenously, it helps the two firms choose the same strategy; moreover, the endogenous wholesale price leads to Pareto improvement in the supply chain."

A distributed blockchain application performs the vital functions of a trusted third party by using computer algorithms and cryptography to confirm asset authenticity, authenticate asset ownership, and validate transactions. Blockchains enable organizations to transact directly with each other. With a blockchain application, every participating organization has an exact copy of the same digital ledger. Furthermore, transactions on the shared ledger are immutable, which means every party can be confident they are dealing with the same data. With one version of the truth transparently available to all parties, there are no reconciliations, which enables faster settlement times and lower transaction costs. 3 (More information about blockchain technology is included in Appendix A.) Initial research focused on the application of blockchain technology in the financial industry, but more recently supply chains have emerged as the most promising sector. Market forecasters estimate that between $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion was spent on blockchain technologies in 2018 to enhance traceability and transparency in supply chains and to save costs. 4,5 A recent study found that blockchain technology was being deployed to realize value from provenance. 4 ""Does blockchain hold the key to a new age of supply chain transparency and trust?

By allowing for ledgers of collaboration-critical data to be reliably maintained between stakeholders without intermediaries, these solutions might enable unprecedented degrees of automation across organizational boundaries, which could have major implications for supply chain integration, medical journal sharing and many other use cases. However, these technologies tend to break with prevailing business practices by relying on code-as-contracts and distributed consensus algorithms, which can impose disruptive requirements on contract language, cooperation governance and interaction privacy. In this paper, we show how our Exchange Network architecture could be applied to avoid these disruptors. To be able to reason about the adequacy of our architecture, we present six requirements for effective contractual collaboration, which notably includes negotiable terms and effective adjudication. After outlining the architecture and our implementation of it, we describe how the latter meets our requirements by facilitating (1) negotiation, (2) user registries, (3) ownership ledgers and (4) definition sharing, as well as by only replicating ledgers between stakeholder pairs. To show how our approach compares to other solutions, we also consider how Corda, Fabric and Ethereum meet our requirements.

This form of future manufacturing is called Industry 4.0, or the Industrial Internet of Things, and it presents both enormous business opportunities and challenges. Businesses have to radically change their current processes, procedures, products, and services in order to benefit from this development. The aim of this study is to investigate this current development by considering related technologies, business requirements, and strategic approaches that need to be applied by manufacturing companies to perform this transformation successfully. The research study includes a review of relevant literature, and reports on extensive practical research (based on an inductive qualitative research approach), whereby 40 reports from leading consulting companies were analysed, and semi-structured interviews with 11 industry experts were conducted. According to the research findings, this development is widely seen as an industrial revolution with two groups of identified technology driver: the main driver includes Cyber-Physical Systems, Big Data & Analytics, Cloud Computing, and IT-Security Systems, all of which offer tremendous opportunities for manufacturing businesses; and, the second group comprises technologies including Autonomous Robots, Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality, and Simulation (all of which are related to this development in a wider sense). From the findings, 10 generalized business requirements have been identified, the most important of which are a ‘Digital Organisational Mind-Set’, ‘Digital Infrastructure’, ‘Future Workforce’, and ‘Collaboration in the Ecosystem’. The other requirements included ‘Data and Cyber Security’, ‘Smart Innovation Processes’, ‘Digital Value and Supply Chain’, ‘Digital Product and Service Portfolio’, Capitalizing on the Value of Data’, and ‘New Types of Business Models’; these are more specific, and depend on individual company circumstances. Based on this study’s findings, a Digital Transformation Model has been proposed, which builds upon the theoretical framework (which comprises all research findings), and which can be applied by the manufacturing industry in their business practices. The main conclusions drawn from this study are that Industry 4.0 (I40) resp. Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) present significant opportunities and challenges, not only for individual manufacturing businesses, but also for the entire manufacturing industry as well as the global economy. The means of preparing and transforming businesses to meet the demands of I40 resp. IIoT will inevitably take the form of joint projects, and will not be a ‘one-player game’; collaboration and cooperation amongst businesses and other partners will be fundamental. Manufacturing businesses are recommended to start this transformation immediately, regardless of their size and objectives. Companies should follow a systematic and strategic approach that allows them to exploit the short-term and especially long-term potential benefits of I40 resp. IIoT, whilst still being flexible enough to react quickly and embark on new developments."

Through AI, machine learning, robotics, and advanced analytics, firms are augmenting knowledge-intensive areas such as supply chain planning, customer order management, and inventory tracking. What does that mean for the supply chain workforce? It does not mean human workers will become obsolete. In fact, a new book by Paul Daugherty and H. James Wilson debunks the widespread misconception that AI systems will replace humans in one industry after another. While AI will be deployed to manage certain tasks, including higher-level decision making, the technology’s true power is in augmenting human capabilities — and that holds true in the supply chain. Insight Center Adopting AI Sponsored by SAS How companies are using artificial intelligence in their business operations. In this new environment, both machines and humans are essential: By collaborating in roles such as supply chain planning and inventory management, the combined power of humans and machines will create new sources of value for businesses. We’ve explored the nature of the new value-enhancing roles that will emerge and identified three new categories of AI-driven jobs: Trainers who help AI systems learn how to perform, which includes everything from helping natural language processors and language translators make fewer errors, to teaching AI algorithms how to mimic human behaviors. Explainers who interpret the results of algorithms to improve transparency and accountability for AI decision making and processes. Sustainers who ensure intelligent systems stay true to their original goals without crossing ethical lines or reinforcing bias. AI, combined with advanced analytics, will enable supply chain planners to make more forward-looking, strategic decisions and spend less time on reactive problem solving. These planners will lead the charge in moving away from a traditional supply chain operating model, which is inflexible and slow, to a new dynamic model with true end-to-end segmentation. That means planning multiple supply chains that meet the needs of specific customer micro-segments as well as managing business relationships and exceptions. Concurrently, a new digital engineer role will emerge: a highly analytical, digitally savvy data scientist who manages, models, and tweaks the algorithms, alert protocols, and parameters guiding the automated decision-making planning systems. The importance of strong analytical skills will grow with the demand for human workers with a digital engineer’s skill set. Leading companies recognize this change is coming and are starting to evolve their supply chain workforces. According to Accenture Strategy research, 90% of executives believe this workforce will become adept at digital technologies such as augmented reality, 3D printing, and automation. And 92% of executives surveyed said supply chain workforces will be upskilled and enabled to interact and work with machines seamlessly. In other words, supply chain workers are already beginning to adjust to work effectively with a range of intelligent technologies — from cobots to robots to virtual agents — to get tomorrow’s jobs done. For example, these technologies can help reinforce correct procedures on the shop floor, monitoring how employees execute tasks and coaching them to do it the best way. Thyssenkrupp is overcoming skill mismatches through AI. The industrial services giant equips its elevator technicians to consult subject-matter experts through Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality headset. Supply chain leaders need to ready their people for this inevitable shift that is already under way. That means making the commitment to reskill and move people to other areas of the business where they can add value. A major consumer goods company applied machine learning to complement more-traditional techniques for forecasting, which increased accuracy for forecasts and inventory management and made unnecessary the manual reviews and calculations that previously took almost 80% of the time. As a result, the company refocused human workers to provide valuable market intelligence. Here are other ways supply chain leaders can continue this momentum and enable human workers to work together with AI in the most effective way: Attract the future workforce. Now is the time to identify exceptional talent by looking outside of the supply chain. Data scientists, risk managers, and business development leads are among the types of employees that can bring significant value to the supply chain. Companies should also ensure their workplaces reflect the ethos of the new supply chain by integrating mobility, technology, and collaboration tools and by reinforcing new behaviors and mindsets throughout the talent development life cycle. Recruitment, performance metrics, and career advancement all need to be viewed through a lens of technology-driven innovation. Remove the robot from the human. Prioritize and define both immediate and longer-term opportunities for AI, based on specific roles and tasks. AI systems will only continue to evolve and get smarter in their decision-making abilities. Consequently, it’s imperative to redirect and reskill human workers to focus on high-value initiatives such as customer experience and innovation. Place your innovation bets. Think big but start small by mapping opportunities to integrate AI with existing technology solutions. Until now, robots, big data, analytics, and other technologies have been used in parallel with people, but in isolation. Their role: improve process efficiencies. Now, with AI systems that can sense, communicate, interpret, and learn, all that changes. AI can help businesses move beyond automation to elevate human capabilities that unlock new value.

These services offer, for example, consistent global networking platforms and shared real-time information. Furthermore, they enable quick decision making and ensure efficiency, which may strengthen competitive advantages as to digital processes within the supply chain (SC). However, research lacks a paper that systematically analyzes the interrelation between CC and SCM in detail and aims to become a reference point in the intersection of both research fields. Moreover, the purpose of this paper is to gain a deep understanding of the current state of research and to identify future research challenges. Design/methodology/approach – This paper provides a cross-discipline systematic literature review from the research perspectives of ISs and SCM. In total, 99 papers have been investigated by combining qualitative and quantitative content analysis. As a side effect the authors developed a new methodological framework for conducting comprehensive literature reviews that could be applied by future research. Finding – The authors discover the most important influence factors for CC implementations in SC processes and pay special attention to major issues, research methods, applied theoretical concepts, and geographical differences. Until now, SCM research in the realm of CC usage is still in its infancy both in theory and practice. Research limitations/implications – Possibly not all of the relevant papers have been filtered during the paper selection phase. The findings of the literature review and the conceptual framework identifying different areas of concern are believed to be useful for future research to obtain an overview of the evolution of CC in SC processes.

Most of these games are specifically designed to focus on certain scenarios and concepts. For example, the original beer distribution game focuses on a single product supply chain without considering capacity and process reliability into account. This creates challenges for extending the games to cover other concepts in SCM. To tackle this problem, we propose a board game, titled ThinkLog, as a face-to-face extendable framework to facilitate learning in SCM. It can be extended to generate different scenarios for various concepts in SCM without changing the basic game structure. Using this principle, we have extended the basic version of ThinkLog to two other scenarios, namely: humanitarian logistics and urban logistics, by simply modifying the rule of the game. Each scenario would have different learning objectives embedded in the gameplay. The game is also complemented with a computer-based application (digital application) to enhance the overall learning experience and collect relevant data (data gathering) during a game session. These three scenarios have been evaluated on four-interactive sessions with government officials and policy- makers in Indonesia. Each session has been consistent in its acceptance of the game as a tool to facilitate learning in SCM, regardless of the scenarios that we played. Our learning objective evaluation also shows that the game is effective in deepening the players' understanding of SCM concepts."

An interdigitated capacitive sensor coated with a thin film of Polyaniline(PANi) that has a higher affinity towards Ammonia is used as a sensing element. To determining the sensitivity of the sensing element, (i) Wireless Near field Short range technique (Capacitance change), and (ii) Direct Probing (Resistance change) techniques are evaluated. The short range technique consists of an inductor coupled to the interdigitated capacitor to form an LC tank and the resonance (capacitance) change due to Ammonia loading is read using a pick-up coil. The direct probe technique uses two wires to measure the resistance across the interdigitated capacitor as a function of Ammonia concentration. Among the two techniques, for demonstrating long range sensing with digitization, direct probing is chosen as this is more stable and can detect a minimum of 3 ppm of Ammonia at room temperature with a response time of 30 min and recovery time of 60 min. The long range approach consists of an RF front end with an antenna and an energy harvester and a low power digital backend that converts the sensor data into bits for transmission. The entire system is passive in nature and does not require an external power supply for operation making it a low cost and simple solution that can be easily integrated as part of the RFID infrastructure.

However, one element of retail that has had a comparatively slow pace of change has been the supply chain, which is often still paper-based and can be prone to errors. The lack of transparency within some supply chains has presented retailers with a host of challenges, from being accused of unacceptable warehouse working practices, high cost and delays in transportation, through to contamination, damage, loss and wastage of products, and scandals about the provenance and authenticity of everything from designer watches to mincemeat. This has led to an erosion of consumer trust in retailers' operations. This is where blockchain comes in – a technology that has the potential to transform the retail supply chain over the next few years.

It relies on critical infrastructure throughout, in the form of water, energy, communication (digital and analogue), and transportation. Disruption to any part of any of these systems can cascade through to other parts of the supply chain and is likely to have unexpected consequences that are felt elsewhere in the world. Resilience requires a whole systems approach. Often, the resilience of transportation infrastructure (road, rail, marine, aviation) is taken for granted-until it fails. In this article, evidence is drawn from different systems, geographies, and stakeholders to show how a more integrated approach can enhance the resilience of transportation infrastructure networks and, consequently, the global food supply chains that rely on them.

Twenty cases are analyzed following a Research Framework, to map: (i) the Circular Economy 4R strategies of reduce, reuse, remanufacture and recycle; (ii) the Circular Economy levers, i.e., whether circular product design practices, servitized business models or supply chain management actions are undertaken; (iii) the role of digital 4.0 technologies as enablers; (iv) the benefits achieved. The analysis showed that servitized business models and supply chain management actions are widely used levers, while little attention is devoted to circular product design practices. Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Cloud emerged as powerful enablers of servitized business models. Two main patterns of Circular Economy adoption in the household appliance industry emerged from cases: incremental and radical adoption patterns. Incremental adoption patterns are based on design strategies focused on reduce and recycle, mainly led by manufacturers. Radical adoption patterns are instead focused on disruptive practices based on reuse, remanufacture, servitization and sharing, where digital 4.0 technologies serve as enablers. Overall, this exploratory research lays the foundation for a stronger and more systemic understanding of the adoption of Circular Economy in the household appliance industry."

Using an engaged research approach, longitudinal data from three consecutive ramp ups in a European telecom operator were collected. Through analyses of cases, qualitative and quantitative case data, and using a system dynamics model, we identified a set of issues that affect service ramp ups and ramp downs. These include the need to ramp up the service supply chain, biases leading to unrealistic assumptions about scalability and problem-solving, decision biases in various functions, launching digital services in beta form, a lack of transparency of capacity and lack of learning from previous ramp ups. We show that if these problems are not addressed or resolution is delayed, this can lead to cycles of delay, backlogs and productivity problems and the inevitability of a ramp down.

Through analysis of the data collected from 405 respondents, it was found that the most important factors when selecting a digital freight forwarder are the existence of both sales and dispatch departments. Furthermore, apart from greening the industry, a digital freight forwarder has several other advantages for all stakeholders and society. The study concludes that the concept has the potential to disrupt the entire industry through a unique combination of efficiency, transparency, and sustainability."

With the rapid advance of renewable energies (which are constantly subject to fluctuations), the electricity generation is distributed to countless locations. The traditional model of the unidirectional flow of electricity is leaning towards multidirectional flows. This situation needs significant changes in the transport infrastructure of the electrical power system and mode of operation. Technological advancements are making a smarter and more organized management system of electricity supply and demand. This development needs to incorporate modern communication, monitoring, and control capabilities, along with the intelligent transport, generation, and storage value chain. Digital substations integrate thousands of sensors by providing greater comfort, self-reliance, availability, and safety while at the same time reducing costs, risks, and environmental damage. Conventional power system lacks digital communication, remote monitoring & control, and consumer participation. Fiber-optic cabling in digital substations will attain not only real-Time data transmission but also remote maintenance. The comparison between conventional and digital substations has also been presented in this work along with latest trends in smart protection. Electronic protection and control devices based on a microprocessor, communicating with cloud servers, will enhance the flexibility to control and monitor the digital substations. A significant amount of data generated by components in the electrical substations will allow greater sophistication of the monitoring, diagnostic, protection and optimization capabilities of the facilities. The goal for the review of said advancements is to have a smart electrical system with greater efficiency and better user experience."

State-of-the-art passenger jets are grounded because of a malfunctioning part. A strike halts shipments through a major port. A new digital device decimates the sales of other brands and sends established firms to the brink of bankruptcy. The interconnectedness of the global economy today means that unexpected events in one corner of the globe can ripple through the world's supply chain and affect customers everywhere. In this book, Yossi Sheffi shows why modern vulnerabilities call for innovative processes and tools for creating and embedding corporate resilience and risk management. Sheffi offers fascinating case studies that illustrate how companies have prepared for, coped with, and come out stronger following disruption -- from the actions of Intel after the 2011 Japanese tsunami to the disruption in the ""money supply chain"" caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Sheffi, author of the widely read The Resilient Enterprise, focuses here on deep tier risks as well as corporate responsibility, cybersecurity, long-term disruptions, business continuity planning, emergency operations centers, detection, and systemic disruptions. Supply chain risk management, Sheffi shows, is a balancing act between taking on the risks involved in new products, new markets, and new processes -- all crucial for growth -- and the resilience created by advanced risk management."

The present article examines in detail 32 information and communications technology (ICT) innovation cases collected between autumn 2013 and spring 2015. Leading actors along the maritime supply chain were asked to indicate the importance and to assess the degree of the success achieved in each ICT innovation initiative, to identify the driving forces behind the adoption of innovation and to denote the associated costs and benefits. This input allows identifying the barriers of digital innovation from initiation through to implementation, as well as assessing the impact of facilitators of ICT innovation. To do this, the present research combines four quantitative instruments. The added value of this combined approach is a deeper understanding of the digital innovation process within the port sector. The research firstly indicates that alignment exists between company strategies and success degrees in the port sector, in contrast to non-ICT initiatives. The ICT innovation initiatives are also profit driven. Secondly, the port sector should be more open to disclose cost and benefit information and should conduct more such analyses. Next, there are conditions that improve the degree of success. Overall, terminal alignment with the right ICT infrastructure proves key. However, too many divergent interests among the stakeholders entail that digital innovation challenges the ability to cooperate. An important finding is regulation was not identified as a barrier nor as a facilitator."

Methods: In this study, we designed a long elliptical flap based on a propeller perforator flap and located slightly toward the dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The flap with a pedicle consisting of the dorsal perforator of the distal digital artery and dorsal digital artery perforator chain is rotated to cover a large wound on the distal end. From December 2014 to December 2017, 10 patients with finger soft tissue defects were treated with the propeller perforator flap described in this study. Results: All flaps survived after surgery, and 2 had a transient venous congestion. After a follow-up period of 3 to 12 months, the static two-point discrimination of the flap was 8.06 ± 1.75 mm, and the range of motion was 149.4 ± 12.9°. This designed flap can span several angiosomes supplied by the perforators. Due to the inclusion of a vessel chain between the dorsal digital artery perforators, the length-to-width ratio of the flap can be up to 3:1. Conclusions: This technique increases the size of flap that can be harvested safely while retaining a reliable blood supply. The present study describes a new method for repairing soft tissue defects of the finger by using the technique of propeller perforator flaps based on dorsal digital artery perforator chains.

Due to the high unpredictability in the quality of returned devices however, determining trade-in margins is a challenging task for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). This inevitably reveals the need for incorporating intelligent technologies into the formation of manufacturing and logistics architectures to simultaneously preserve OEMs profitability and ensure the sustainable development of the closed-loop supply chain activities.

Against the backdrop of almost non-existent logistic and supply chain infrastructure, weak regulatory framework, low penetration of smartphones and Internet, low consumer confidence and trust on online transactions, digital entrepreneurs in developing countries literally have to build the platform ecosystem along with their organization. In this paper, we use institutional theory as a lens to trace the emergence and evolution of digital platforms in India. We posit that digital platforms are emerging organizational fields embodying new network logics with algorithms and technology-mediated interactions playing a central role in creating value. In particular, we take the case of Ola, an online cab aggregator from India to illustrate that digital platforms as organizational field evolve through three phases of (a) innovation introduction, (b) mobilization and (c) structuration. In the first phase, the organizational field characteristics are consequences of activities undertaken to raise cognitive legitimacy and respond to competitive forces. In the second phase, a mix of coercive and mimetic forces shape the institutional field resulting in increase in socio-political legitimacies. In the third phase, the process of structuration sets in as isomorphic forces become more normative. The theoretical framework developed in this paper contributes to extant information system research by putting forth that the characteristics of emerging organizational field are shaped by the interplay between the responses of the focal organization to isomorphic forces, and the actions taken by it to establish cognitive and socio-political legitimacies. Empirically the study is on digital platforms located in a large developing country with very high potential for online transactions but relatively low penetration of Internet and smartphones. Conceptualizing organizational field as digital platforms enables making sense of the changing business landscape, and examine issues of sustainability and legitimacy."

This paper investigates a single-manufacturer and a single-buyer two echelon supply chain model for a fixed lifetime product in a fuzzy cost environment with a quantity discount strategy as a coordination mechanism. Crisp models are developed under different scenarios (1) without coordination (2) with coordination and (3) system optimization.

This paper proposes a fully automatic integrated digital PCR device based on continuous-flow digital PCR theory. By simply adding the sample to the entrance of the integrated instrument, a series of procedures required for digital PCR detection can be fully automated, including sample injection, droplet generation, PCR thermal cycling, fluorescence acquisition, and signal analysis. In contrast to traditional techniques, sample testing requires only one integrated device rather than three separate instruments. For full automation, we design complete control and data processing software, which can complete a test by one-step operation. Therefore, the disadvantages of traditional instruments, such as multi-step operation, and hence, potential environmental pollution, are avoided. Moreover, the system can be powered by solar cells and does not require an external power supply. As a proof of concept, the proposed device is used for absolute quantitative detection of the hepatitis B virus in serum samples. The capacity of the system is validated by absolute quantification of three orders of magnitude from 103 to 105 IU/mL. The results have a good linear correlation (0.9986) with those of the traditional quantitative (qPCR), thus confirming the reliability of the instrument. In summary, we believe that our work can promote the development of integrated digital PCR systems."

It was only when applied to the distribution process, the governance-granting process, that its impacts were fully deployed, allowing the entry of new types of players adopting new business models and challenging the former governance pattern: the hierarchical governance was replaced by a pattern in which agents organise themselves in project-based, adhoc configurations, and market access is not controlled by large companies."

The redesigning of the logistic system and the reconfiguration of the supply chain management (SCM) challenge the firms, especially the small ones, to explore new e-business applications, on the basis of feasibility studies before getting implemented. For a long time, firms considered that commercial changes are the last solution to resolve SCM problems, however many supply chains have been a failure. The explanation resides in the fact that a number of companies that had integrated their supply chains noticed that there was little or no response to the existing requests in this field. Although commercial changes represent an important part of Business to Business programs, actually very few managers understand the way to deal with them, which is integrating them in e-business programs. This paper outlines the companies' need to develop e-business programs and the importance of these programs for the whole supply chain to obtain performances, taking into account that many firms that get integrated in the supply chain lack the technological capacity to implement electronic means for processing, transmitting and receiving data. One remedy might be their initiative to use Business to Business programs, with the purpose to offer easily configurable optimized networks and interactive solutions based on Web, at competitive prices. This system should have different assisting functions to help the partners of a supply chain, especially the small firms, to easily integrate up-to-date management and informational system refinement methods, in an efficient and effective way. As it has been pointed out in the paper, a major role for the enhancement of SCM performances is information technology such as Internet and ERP systems. Internet offers important opportunities to all partners from the supply chain to get information about consumption tendencies and changes in consumption request, virtual information about a product and the clients' requests regarding the logistic services. As for ERP systems, it can be said that they mostly influence the designing of business processes, in order to assure coherence between them and the effective integration of different firm components. Even though the internal integration is an important aspect, an approach to management at the supply chain level, in an efficient and effective way, cannot be done without external integration with suppliers and clients. That is why we consider that companies belonging to the business field must focus on structuring key processes, to collaborate with their clients and suppliers and to integrate their internal systems, with the aim to support business operations.

According to a UN study, between 2009 and 2014, the global annual production of electronic waste has been approximately fixed at 42 million tonnes. The improper and unscientific disposal of e-waste is a big threat to the environment. The purpose of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the network design of a multi-product, multi-echelon reverse logistics system. Different recovery options such as remanufacturing, repairing and recycling are considered in this study. Based on the residual value of the used product, the returns are graded into two categories—low product residual value (PRV) and high PRV returns. Although the process of grading results in additional grading costs, it assists the decision maker in choosing appropriate recovery option. An integer linear programming formulation is used to model and solve the problem. Two commonly used consumer electronic goods, mobile phones and digital cameras, are considered for validation. The proposed model determines the optimal number and location of different facilities to be established. By way of explicit consideration of the product structure, the analysis is carried out down to the level of components across the different stages of the supply chain. Further, detailed analysis is performed to determine minimum quantities of high PRV returns for a remanufacturing facility to be economically viable. The results provide interesting information about the relevance of quantum of products with high PRV on the network design decisions. Also, the results underscore the importance of transportation costs on the overall profitability of the reverse supply chain."

In a bid to improve availability of medicines in primary health care facilities, the South African department of Health launched the Stock Visibility Solution (SVS), a mobile application developed for the purpose of capturing and monitoring stock levels of medicines including vaccines using mobile phones. The stock levels of medicines in facilities are usually uploaded to the central stock management system so that managers can act promptly to address stock-out situations. Pilot studies show that the SVS has the potential to reduce stock-outs from occurring. This study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of the SVS system amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) who are involved with managing stock levels of medicines in primary health care facilities in the Eastern Cape Province. This will help identify potential barriers and facilitators to implementation of the system and contribute to the development of strategies to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. A qualitative research design was employed, including semi-structured interviews with 64 HCWs working in primary health care facilities in the OR Tambo district, Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. Data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Most HCWs understood the SVS as a system for reporting stock levels to managers and conveyed commitment to ensuring the system works. However, they highlighted a number of factors that demotivated efficient usage of the system: inadequate training, staff shortages and high staff turnover, lack of responses from the managers, the extra workload that comes with the system, amongst others. HCWs made various suggestions for how the system might be improved, most pertinently the need for more pharmacists and pharmacy assistants and for these cadres to be primarily in-charge of stock management and the use of the SVS. While HCWs are committed to addressing vaccine stock-outs, they face various barriers to an effective and efficient implementation of the SVS system. We make various recommendations for how these barriers might be addressed."

The paper examines the existing models of supply chain management, the newer model of e-supply chain management, as well as additional Internet-based services that are available to SMEs. There are several disadvantages that are characterizing the traditional model and can potentially be solved through the e-supply chain model and additional services, such as cloud computing.

The authors theoretically advance value chain theory by, firstly, considering the influence of community type and age on consumption and, secondly, exploring the role that consumers can play in value-adding activities. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in moving from a transactional approach towards consumer relationships in the value chain towards managing consumers as a source of relational value (e.g. co-creation and integrated perspectives). Design/methodology/approach – The conceptual framework is theoretically positioned in relation to community and digital community practices in the social era. A series of research questions are presented, then these questions are explored drawing on empirical data from the Pew database. The authors then advance the framework further to consider news firm strategy towards its consumers. Fifteen in-depth executive interviews were conducted with local news organizations in the Manchester area of the UK. Findings – The authors illustrate that different types of communities (merging cohorts and locations) are influencing levels of technological and social connectivity within the value chain. The authors also found that the news industry is experimenting with reconfiguring its consumer relations from a purely transactional to a co-created and participatory value-added activity in the social era. In terms of its policy impact, the findings in this paper show that the whole strategic value chain ideology of the news industry needs to change radically; away from its largely transactional (and lack of trust) approach in the ability of consumers to create value in the supply chain (other than to buy a product) and, move towards much greater consumer involvement and participation in value chain processes (creation, production and distribution of news products and services). Originality/value – The change associated with social media and connectivity is changing the way that different community types and consumer groups are now consuming and participating in news content creation. Unlike previous studies, the authors show that there is variance and complexity in the levels of consumer participation by community type/age group. Using the Pew data, the authors contribute to knowledge on the value creation strategy of news firms in the social era, by identifying how communicative, social and communicative logics influence value and co-creation activities in the local news supply chain. Through interviews, the authors advance value co-creation theory from its strategic and marketing origins to operational and supply chain implementation."

The digitization is likely to be an exponential journey for many businesses in world. Technological innovations and changing customer expectations require new business models and organizational principles in the textile industry. Research suggests that those who embrace this challenge and execute a digital strategy outperform average industry standards by as much as 10%.

Exports of the industry are expected to double in the next five years, thereby leading to a robust demand for modern technology and accessories, along with engineering. Being an industry which relies heavily on fine details such as equipment monitoring, stock management for dyes and raw material, supply chain visibility, workforce management and coordination, and analysis, thus, becomes the most eligible one for digital transformation.

The problem is, the world is not predictable. advertisement Supply Chains Pivot Uncertainty Management MIT SMR Frontiers This article is part of an MIT SMR initiative exploring how technology is reshaping the practice of management. When Nestlé, the world’s second biggest food and beverage company, chose José Lopez to serve as its global chief operations officer, he shared the exciting news with his mother. “But what does that mean, exactly?” she wanted to know. Lopez could have explained that he would be responsible for manufacturing spanning 440 factories in 86 countries, as well as supply chains including customer service and physical logistics across 1,300 warehouses and shipment points. Instead, he simply replied, “It means I will be blamed for whatever goes wrong.” Operations executives tended to receive that anecdote just as Lopez delivered it — with a wry smile — because it captured the essence of their daily reality. Working with operations executives across various industries, we’ve heard many similar sentiments articulated about the changing nature of the demand curve and the element of uncertainty in the supply chain in the digital age. For operations teams, the challenge and competitive advantage becomes: How well do you respond and execute against ongoing uncertainty? Chaos Is Normal This central challenge points to a truth most companies have yet to fully contend with — the world is not predictable. In fact, chaos is normal. Timetables and priorities shift. A supplier fails to deliver. You get hit with costs no one saw coming. Some surprises are bigger than others, but when you’re the one who still has to get the job done, no surprise feels small. Further, demands on supply chains are increasing exponentially as companies vie to meet consumer desire for more personalized products and services, delivered exactly when and where they specify, very quickly, at the same low cost. Just a few years ago, supply chain performance was all about batch quantities, timetables, and lead times. Now companies are shipping millions of packages a day, many with just one or a few items. Trailblazers like Stitch Fix and Warby Parker actually encourage customers to order multiple sizes and colors of the same item, choose the one they like best, and return the rest. Yet, in the face of this upheaval, supply chains still try to predict what will happen, then optimize performance against plan. More often than not, those plans are not met. This generally triggers nonproductive finger-pointing, even when the failure stemmed from unanticipated challenges rather than poor execution. Meanwhile, companies continue to increase investments in supply chain capabilities, many times with disappointing results. Something is clearly missing. It is time to pursue a bold leap in supply chain performance. Moving Toward Pivoting Supply Chains The path forward mirrors the advance from paper road maps to modern GPS systems. The earliest GPS was essentially a digital map that led drivers through a predetermined route faster and with greater ease than a paper map. But as early GPS could not account for traffic jams, road hazards, or other variables, it did not warn drivers to pivot or course-correct to account for the unplanned. Similarly, many companies are currently making major investments in digitizing and automating their supply chains to make them better informed, more frictionless, more cost-efficient, and hence more capable. Those efforts are necessary, but not sufficient. If you simply digitize your supply chain, you may achieve great improvements in speed, efficiency, and reliability, but your supply chain is still not built to pivot."

Supply chain management is the process of sending the goods from the point of origin to the point of destination i.e., customer. Logistics plays an important role and an integral part of the supply chain management in handling the movement of goods. In this paper, we are trying to highlight the Government initiative and investment made in the logistics sector in India during recent years. And also, we are trying to outline some of the challenges are faced in the logistics sector in India. The entire paper is studied from the secondary source of data and we are tried to highlight the key issues, job opportunities, GDP growth and ranking among the world which is happened in logistics sector in recent years. Recently, the Government of India initiatives like Make in India, Skill India, Digital India, etc., will help to fillip the growth of logistics sector in India. Since, India is having the advantage of enormous population and thereby creating a new buddy entrepreneur among the youngsters."

As a result, a transformation in manufacturing sites is taking place. In the field of IoT, the ultimate goal is to use networks to connect facilities and equipment that incorporate sensors, and to maximize added value and cost reductions over the whole manufacturing process by enabling equipment to operate autonomously and cooperatively. It is also important to connect with partner factories via the Internet to optimize the entire supply chain. In the future, by linking manufacturing sites together, it will be possible to implement advanced “digital manufacturing” by making use of digital data. However, in many Japanese manufacturing industries, information is fragmented even within the same company’s flow of design, production, and maintenance, making it impossible to link this information smoothly. To solve this problem, Fujitsu has devised an open platform, FUJITSU Manufacturing Industry Solution COLMINA, for the interconnection of all information related to manufacturing. COLMINA facilitates linkages on various levels, including the linkage of systems and know-how related to manufacturing in general, and the linkage of supply chains between corporations. This paper presents an outline of the COLMINA service."

From February 9, all blood establishments in Hubei province, China, implemented nucleic acid testing (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 RNA among blood donors to ensure blood safety. Study Design and Methods: Nucleic acid test screening individually (ID) or by minipool (MP) testing was performed according to the manufacturerʼs instructions. Inactivated culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2–infected Vero cells was quantified by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) and series diluted with negative plasma to evaluate the assayʼs performance. Results: The limit of detection of the kit for MP testing was 62.94 and 33.14 copies/mL for N and ORF1ab region, respectively. ID testing could achieve 3.87 and 4.85 copies/mL for two regions using 1600 μL of plasma. Coefficients of variations of two different concentrations of reference samples were all less than 5% in MP testing. As of April 30, 2020, a total of 98,342 blood donations including 87,095 whole blood donations and 11,247 platelet donations were tested by ID or MP testing, and no RNAemia was found. In addition, Hubei province suffered precipitously decreased blood supply, especially in February: 86% reduction compared with the same period of 2019. Conclusion: Nucleic acid test screening of SARS-CoV-2 on blood donations is suitable in blood establishments using the commercial real-time PCR detection kit based on available instruments. The negative result indicated that SARS-CoV-2 appears to be no direct threat to blood safety but raises some serious issues for general blood supply."

Since on LED datasheets there is only limited information provided, companies designing LED luminaires spend a lot of effort gathering the required input of LED details to be able to design reliable products. Small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) do not have the bandwidth to gather such input and solely rely on empirical approaches leading to approximated luminaire designs, while larger companies use advanced hardware and software tools to characterize parts, design versions, and finally optimize all design steps. In both cases, considerable time and money is spent on prototyping, sampling, and laboratory testing. Digitalization of the complete product development (also known as Industry 4.0 approach) at all integration levels of the solid state lighting (SSL) supply chain would provide the remedy for these pains. The Delphi4LED European project aimed at developing multi-domain compact models of LED (for a consistent, combined description of electronic, thermal, and optical properties of LEDs) as digital twins of the physical products to support virtual prototyping during the design of luminaires. This paper provides an overview of the Delphi4LED approach aimed at supporting new, completely digital workflows both for SMEs and larger companies (Majors) along with some comparison with the traditional luminaire design. Two demonstration experiments are described: One to show the achievable benefits of the approach and another one to demonstrate the ease of use and ability to be accommodated in a larger scale product design for assessing design choices like e.g., number and type of LEDs versus electrical/thermal conditions and constraints, in a tool agnostic manner."

Mass customisation (MC) is about developing a customised product on demand for a particular customer after reception of a real order and producing it with the similar operational efficiency as one would anticipate from a mass-produced product. MC takes into account the merits of both the earlier systems of production, i.e. mass production and craft production. The craft production satisfies the personalised demands of customers and the mass production produces a limited variety of products at lower cost. Industries in developing countries such as India confront pressure from several perspectives to adopt MC. This study has been presented in the context of Indian manufacturing industries, and particularly for footwear industries to examine the enablers of MC. Achieving MC, however, require certain enabling technologies and processes in place. Several such enablers have been identified from the research literature. The objective of this study it to key out significantly important enablers for MC using interpretive structural modelling (ISM), and develop a hierarchy of these enablers for the Indian footwear units. ISM results show that modularity-based practices, digital manufacturing practices and supply chain integration are the most important MC enablers.

The readout chain is fabricated in a standard 150-nm CMOS technology and contains a cascade of a preamplification and noise reduction stage based on a parametric chopper amplifier and a direct analog-to-digital conversion by means of an incremental ΣΔ converter, performing a lock-in operation with modulated sources. The FET detector is integrated with an on-chip antenna operating in the frequency range of 325-375 GHz and compliant with all process design rules. The cascade of the FET THz detector and readout chain is evaluated in terms of responsivity and Noise Equivalent Power (NEP) measurements. The measured readout input-referred noise of 1.6 μVrms allows preserving the FET detector sensitivity by achieving a minimum NEP of 376 pW/ √Hz in the optimum bias condition, while directly providing a digital output. The integrated readout chain features 65-dB peak-SNR and 80-μW power consumption from a 1.8-V supply. The area of the antenna-coupled FET detector and the readout chain fits a pixel pitch of 455 μm, which is suitable for pixel array implementation. The proposed THz pixel has been successfully applied for imaging of concealed objects in a paper envelope under continuous-wave illumination."

On the flip side, it has resulted in various forms of security vulnerabilities in the supply chain that involves designers, fabs, test facilities, and distributors until the end-product reaches customers. One of the biggest threats to semiconductor industry today is the entry of aged, reject, or cloned parts, that is, counterfeit chips, into the supply chain, leading to annual revenue losses in the order of billions of dollars. While traceability of chips between trusted parties can help monitor the supply chain at various points in the flow, existing solutions are in the form of integrating costly hardware units on chip, or utilizing easy-to-circumvent inspection-based detection techniques. In this article, we propose a technique for adaptive unique ID generation that leverages process variations, enabling chip traceability. The proposed method stimulates digital chips with an analog signal from the supply lines, which serve as primary inputs to each gate in the signal path. Using a sinusoidal signal that exercises the transistors as gain components, we create a chip-specific response that can be post-processed into a digital ID. The proposed technique enables quick and cost-effective authenticity validation that requires no on-chip hardware support. Our simulation and experimentation on actual chips show that the proposed technique is capable of generating unique IDs even in the presence of environmental noise."

However, when considering whether to adopt this technology, many business professionals have voiced a lack of a compelling use case as a major challenge. To utilize the technology effectively, first, we need to establish how organizations will connect to the blockchain that will also provide a compelling use-case for CPA firms. In this paper, we design a blockchain architecture for organizations that will facilitate effective connectivity to a blockchain while enabling auditors to leverage this technology to provide audit and assurance services. To design the architecture, we consider two broad questions: first, how do CPA firms gain access to reliable audit evidence and, second, how can client firms maintain confidentiality and security of their data given a decentralized and distributed immutable ledger (i.e., a blockchain). Consequently, the proposed architecture will help auditors gain access to reliable digital audit evidence while incentivizing client firms to adopt blockchain technology by substantially reducing the costs of replacing existing information systems. Given this architecture, auditors could also design continuous audit procedures for their respective clients without having to incur substantial investments in software integration. Further, the architecture can be expanded to include various use cases and supply chain participants, other CPA firms, customers, and regulators."

Evaluating analog defenses requires the usage of non-Boolean variables, such as bias current and gain. Hence, in this work, we evaluate the resilience of the analog-only locks and analog and mixed-signal (AMS) locks using satisfiability modulo theories (SMTs). We demonstrate our attack on five analog locking techniques and three AMS locking techniques. The attack is demonstrated on commonly used circuits, such as bandpass filter (BPF), low-noise amplifier (LNA), and low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator. Attack results on analog-only locks show that the attacker, knowing the required bias current or voltage range, can determine the key. Likewise, knowing the protected input patterns (PIPs), the attacker can determine the key to unlock the AMS locks. We then extend our attack to break the existing analog camouflaging technique."

Theoretically, we offer an understanding of the economic flow, stress the optimization of construction logistics through flow integration, analyse current approaches to understanding blockchain, adopt sociomateriality to envision a suitable blockchain solution, and consider the way blockchain can constitute part of the value proposition of a related digital business model. Methodologically, we systematically reviewed the literature on blockchain-related construction research, and conducted empirical studies on independent logistics consultants in the Swedish context for more than a year. On the one hand, the literature review reveals that core blockchain properties can generate value for construction logistics (e.g. shared ledger structure and reduction of accounting rework) – however, apart from visions and prototypes, there currently exist no use cases, and potential implementational constraints and security issues are limitedly considered. One the other hand, the empirical findings show that independent construction logistics consultants in the sociomaterial Swedish context are suitable candidates for the proposed digital business model. By combining the literature and empirical insights, a permissioned private proof-of-authority blockchain solution integrating the supply chain flows in a generic sociomaterial setting is conceptualized. This solution is then embedded in the value proposition of a digital business model for an independent construction logistics consultant. The proposition includes, among others, improved process management and increased productivity, while the consultants’ competitive advantage through innovation is facilitated. Other business model segments, like key resources, are also updated via the blockchain solution, while some, like channels, are not significantly affected. To not hinder the realization of this digital business model, issues like the lack of blockchain awareness, and the existing power balances within sociomaterial constellations, have to be addressed."

Hence, we present “PrivySharing,” a blockchain-based innovative framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data sharing in a smart city environment. The proposed scheme is distinct from existing strategies on many aspects. The data privacy is preserved by dividing the blockchain network into various channels, where every channel comprises a finite number of authorized organizations and processes a specific type of data such as health, smart car, smart energy or financial details. Moreover, access to users’ data within a channel is controlled by embedding access control rules in the smart contracts. In addition, data within a channel is further isolated and secured by using private data collection and encryption respectively. Likewise, the REST API that enables clients to interact with the blockchain network has dual security in the form of an API Key and OAuth 2.0. The proposed solution conforms to some of the significant requirements outlined in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. We also present a system of reward in the form of a digital token named “PrivyCoin” for users sharing their data with stakeholders/third parties.

In the first section we look at evolving service-oriented architecture to the service-oriented enterprise, and in the second, we examine integrated process and technology reference models. The literature abounds with articles about Service- Oriented Architecture (SOA) and particularly Web service-based SOA. Yet, to be successful within a real enterprise, there needs to be more than simple agreement over protocol, data packaging, service invocation, and discovery. While the latter are essential to SOA by providing a foundation for the creation of services, they do not describe how those services function within the overall enterprise environment. They do not describe, for example, how to deliver reliable, scalable enterprise business processes built upon SOA-i.e., the Service- Oriented Enterprise (SOE). The literature on this topic is remarkably sparse. In the first section of this paper, we explore SOA from the perspective of an SOE where the primary service building blocks execute within a managed SOA eco-system. This managed SOA ecosystem relies upon orchestration, business rules, and process correlation to provide monitoring and management, and business process analytics and autonomics. This framework weaves SOA into the enterprise fabric providing a rich service framework within which to implement enterprise business processes. We begin with an overview of SOE, and then discuss a technology development project to create a Business Rules service. Several usage models are discussed. In a globally connected economy, enhanced collaboration increases visibility of critical supply and demand changes and streamlines the flow of information that governs critical design and supply chain decisions. The main barrier to digital supply chain collaboration is complexity and high costs associated with extensibility of business processes throughout the network of suppliers and customers. Business process extensibility is the ability of an enterprise to conduct digital collaboration with its partners, by extending processes throughout the supply chain to increase visibility and streamline the information flow. Enterprises must be enabled to expose their business processes through SOA while retaining and extending the capabilities normally found in tightly integrated vertical applications. We must comprehend fully those collaboration models and the architectural elements necessary to support them. In the second section of this paper, we explore methods for modeling and implementing business processes within the value chain as an integrated system and introduce a set of principles and guidelines for defining a reference architecture that consistently and accurately represents the value chain as an SOA. We explain how this can be accomplished with a reference model for modeling, simulation, and benchmarking business processes and with a reference architecture that supports deployment and management of collaborative processes within the value chain. Our research with Collaborative Product Development Associates introduced us to a Federation Enterprise Reference Architecture (FERA), a reference architecture that extends SOE to the federated enterprise."

A blockchain-based platform is a prime candidate to improve the industry in general and the construction supply chain (CSC) in particular. In this paper, a literature review is presented to establish the main challenges that CSC faces in terms of its effects on productivity and efficiency. In addition, the effect of applying blockchain platforms on a case study is presented and analyzed from performance and security level. The analysis aims to emphasize that blockchain, as presented in this paper, is a viable solution to the challenges in the CSC regardless of the risks associated with the security and robustness of the flow of information and data protection. Moreover, a threat analysis of applying a blockchain model on the CSC industry is introduced. This model indicates potential attacks and possible countermeasures to prevent the attacks. Future work is needed to expand, quantify, and optimize the threat model and conduct simulations considering proposed countermeasures for the different blockchain attacks outlined in this study."

This article probes the potential of blockchain technology to foster international cooperation among states—given the lack of a world government to enforce their mutual commitments. The article outlines four facilitators of blockchain- based global governance systems, including the need for credible commitment, the availability of resourceful non-state actors, verification needs that can be addressed through ‘oracles’, and routine interactions. These facilitators are further illustrated for the case of climate governance. Overall, the discussion suggests that blockchains—if appropriately designed to address the underlying cooperation problems—hold significant promise. Their key strength is to enable states to design ‘smart contracts’ that execute automatically when agreed conditions are fulfilled. To some extent, blockchain technology thus challenges the primacy of international organizations. However, even with blockchain technology, international organizations continue to play a role with regard to pre-agreement policy deliberation, validating real-world events, and providing technical assistance for policy implementation."

This paper provides the first large-scale empirical evidence on the incidence, nature and profitability of incumbent platforms. Our contribution is threefold: (1) only 10 to 30% of incumbent firms have already engaged in some platform play, with substantial heterogeneity across industries, however; (2) incumbent firms engage in such strategies with a strong focus on their supply chain, suggesting that their platform initiatives are biased toward supply-side economies of scale, rather than demand-side; and (3) platform strategies contribute to revenue and/or profit growth only when they are combined with a priority attached to the demand-side of the business (i.e. customers, instead of the supply chain), typically through the unbundling or rebundling of products or services, and are part of an offensive digital strategy at scale. These results are robust to a Heckman-selection equation and a number of changes to the specification and key measures."

Supply chain and operations managers of supply bases will need to integrate technologies that allow for greater automation, digitalization, flexibility and improved communications among stakeholders. The technologies that are likely to boost integration will consist of a plethora of Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) technologies that may include Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and could be applied for improved monitoring of healthy and safe industrial workplaces for workers. However, little is known regarding how WSN technologies can be implemented on a larger scale and its implications when integrated on standard logistics and operations of industrial workplaces such as a shipping base. The WSN sensor units represent an integrating resource that are capable of monitoring air temperature, humidity and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other gasses and of disseminating this information to different actors in the production system. Air quality factors play a critical role in the perceived levels of workers' comfort and in reported medical health. The low cost of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies offer potential for continuous, autonomous and importantly networked assessment of industrial workplace air quality that may have implications for operations management and quality of production. This paper initially presents a case study that monitors air quality that is collected with WSN technologies from two workshops carried out by a large on-shore logistics base that supports offshore petroleum logistics. The case study demonstrates a monitoring and visualization approach for facilitating BD in decision making for health and safety in the shipping industry. However, with the advancement in IIoT technologies and the emergence of smart sensing and actuating devices, it is possible to form a digital closed-loop system that we argue is essential for managers to link together information about air quality with supply chain and operations management decisions. We propose that central to effective decision making is the data analytics approach and visualization of what is potentially, big data (BD) in monitoring the air quality in industrial workplaces. We discuss how WSN technologies can be integrated into the logistics management and operations of the shipping base. Through an analytical discussion of BD we explore how to extend the potential application of IIoT and Visual Analytics to facilitate a smart workplace for the Industry 4.0 era."

By implementing a series of randomized field experiments, we study the value of virtual fit information in online retail. In our experiments, customers are randomly assigned to a treatment condition where virtual fit information is available or to a control condition where virtual fit information is not available. Our results show that o ering virtual fit information increases conversion rates and order value, and reduces fulfillment costs arising from returns and home try-on behavior, that is, customers ordering multiple sizes of the same product.

Different fields, from journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, frameworks, and measurements. To overcome this fragmentation, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review (1999–2018). This showed a lack of theorizing and linking of conceptual with empirical work in media diversity research. Based on this, we develop a framework on how to move forward: Regarding conceptualization, we call for focusing on different places in the journalistic information chain instead of the classical exposure-supply distinction. Methodologically, automated approaches (e.g., analyzing digital traces) and qualitative approaches (e.g., capturing perceptions of diversity) should receive more attention. For analysis, matters of balance and disparity need to be stressed more, especially discussing possible limits to diversity. Overall, research into media diversity thus needs to be addressed in interdisciplinary collaboration."

There has been concomitant damage to consumer confidence in (i) the safety of food, (ii) the food industry’s commitment to producing safe food and (iii) the authorities’ ability to oversee the food chain. Threats to consumers’ health and their genuine concerns have to be addressed with effective risk management and the protection of public health has to be paramount. Dealing with incorrect fears and misperceptions of risk has also to be addressed but achieving this is very difficult. The competencies of social scientists are needed to assist in gaining insights into consumer perceptions of risk, consumer behaviour and the determinants of trust.

The construction industry is increasingly competing on new bases, implementing a digital approach. The client plays a key role in defining digital requirements and controlling the entire supply chain in the very early phases. Indeed, first, an ‘intelligent’ digital built environment needs an ‘intelligent’ driver. In this scenario, clients should set digital requirements able to control the compliance of offers in a quasi-automated way during tendering and awarding stages. However, the current implementation and understanding on this new attitude is not very clear and there is a gap in literature. For this reason, a deductive approach based on an online questionnaire delivered to a sample of leading European clients has been used to investigate the state of the art. Results indicate that a large number of clients use digital tools to set digital requirements and include digital deliverables in the contract (such as Building Information Models). However, the adoption of e-Procurement platforms and the evaluation of the entire supply chain during the tendering and awarding stages are still limited. Moreover, most of the clients perceive that the quasi-automation of the procurement process can generate benefits and favour risk mitigation for banks and insurances.

The model enables companies in any industry to continuously collect and monitor their customer, product and supply chain data and more precisely adjust engineering, production, distribution and sales/marketing activities to meet current and future demand. Moreover, they can use the same data to enhance their partnership with suppliers. For example, GM has put in place a number of components of a digital loyalty network, including the implementation of an integrated network connecting the company with suppliers, alliance partners, dealers and customers. GM has also adopted a new formula for managing the order-to-delivery process, has launched Web-portals for customers and suppliers and continues to enhance and support its OnStar system, which allows drivers to communicate on the road with GM customer service representatives and vendors. Digital loyalty networks have three components: (1) Digital – the companies use sophisticated information technologies to manage information more effectively; (2) Loyalty – the system is designed to target, satisfy, and retain the most profitable customers and, in turn, use customer information and loyalty data to make the supply chain more efficient; (3) Networks – the information system links suppliers, producers and customers and is continuously updated. DLN companies use information technology resourcefully to increase the effectiveness of supply chain and customer relationship management initiatives. They develop a solid network of digitized information that ties together the value chain and creates loyalty and on both the front and back end of business operations. On the supply side, DLN companies continuously monitor customer value based on feedback about customer requirements, purchase history, and potential purchases and rely on digital technology to make certain their most valuable customers are kept satisfied. They do this by managing inventory through the supply chain so that the best customers are served first, and making certain short and long-term capacity planning responds to these customer priorities. In addition to General Motors, Deloitte Research identified three other innovators in the automotive industry – Porsche, DaimlerChrysler and Renault/Nissan – that are developing certain aspects of a DLN. © 2003, MCB UP Limited"

Design/methodology/approach: A survey was conducted among 100 participants from foundries and AM service providers across the USA to understand the current adoption of AM in metal casting as a function of engineering specifications, production demand, volume and cost metrics. In addition, current technological and logistical challenges that are encountered by the foundries are identified to gather insight into the future direction of this evolving supply chain. Findings: One of the major findings from this study is that hard tooling costs (i.e. patterns/core boxes) are the greatest challenge in low volume production for foundries. Hence, AM and 3DSP offer the greatest cost-benefit for these low volume production runs as it does not require the need for hard tooling to produce much higher profit premium castings. It is evident that there are major opportunities for the casting supply chain to benefit from an advanced digital ecosystem that seamlessly integrates AM and 3DSP into foundry operations. The critical challenges for adoption of 3DSP in current foundry operations are categorized into as follows: capital cost of the equipment, which cannot be justified due to limited demand for 3DSP molds/cores by casting buyers, transportation of 3DSP molds and cores, access to 3DSP, limited knowledge of 3DSP, limitations in current design tools to integrate 3DSP design principles and long lead times to acquire 3DSP molds/cores. Practical implications: Based on the findings of this study, indirect hybrid metal AM supply chains, i.e. 3DSP metal casting supply chains is proposed, as 3DSP replaces traditional mold-making in the sand casting process flow, no/limited additional costs and resources would be required for qualification and certification of the cast parts made from three-dimensional printed sand molds. Access to 3DSP resources can be addressed by establishing a robust 3DSP metal casting supply chain, which will also enable existing foundries to rapidly acquire new 3DSP-related knowledge. Originality/value: This original survey from 100 small and medium enterprises including foundries and AM service providers suggests that establishing 3DSP hubs around original equipment manufacturers as a shared resource to produce molds and cores would be beneficial. This provides traditional foundries means to continue mass production of castings using existing hard tooling while integrating 3DSP for new complex low volume parts, replacement parts, legacy parts and prototyping."

Concerted leadership from administration provided a framework for this interaction to occur while faculty worked off-campus to address the many issues identified by the agricultural community, the industry sector, and other state agencies. During the onset period, much of our work was reactive; our efforts to address worker safety and health involved three primary areas within: 1) production agricultural workers, 2) produce growers and direct marketing enterprises, and 3) meat supply chain workers. Communication to target audiences relied upon our ability to convert face-to-face programming into virtual webinars, social media, and digital publications. A Food System Task Force mobilized specialists to address emerging issues, with one specific topic related to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). As we continue to face new seasons in agriculture production, and pockets of COVID-19 outbreaks within our state, we will continue to address the dynamic needs of our food supply systems. There are implications for how we will teach the agricultural workforce within a virtual platform, including the evaluation of the effectiveness of those training programs. There are renewed opportunities to integrate health and safety content into other Extension teams who conventionally focused on production practices and farm management topics. Several research themes emerged during subgroup dialog to pursue new knowledge in workers’ cultural attitude and barriers, PPE design, PPE access, and overall attitude toward COVID-19 health practices."

We model heterogeneous agent behavior, motives, and interactions to examine the consequences in terms of aggregate system behavior. Using a multi-agent programmable modeling environment (Netlogo), several experiments were conducted to test the simulation model and develop managerial insights. We show that an educational strategy is more effective when consumers are resistant to anti-piracy efforts and budgets for combating piracy are small. Furthermore, value-added service and low-price strategies should be used to encourage legitimate purchases since legal and educational strategies alone deter piracy but do not provide consumers' incentives to purchase legitimate products. Therefore, effectiveness of piracy control strategies can be improved by combining a legal or an educational strategy with a value-added or a low-price strategy. We also find that the profit-maximizing strategies are different for different players in the supply chain. While the record label prefers a low-cost strategy, it is optimal for the whole supply chain to use combined legal or educational strategy with a value-added strategy. Therefore, there is potential for all parties in the supply chain being better off if the record label and the retailer cooperate in combating piracy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Through the structural equation modeling analysis of survey returns from 145 Chinese BIM-enabled projects, this research demonstrates that BIM's degree of implementation can positively affect the acceptability of integrated project delivery (IPD) in the future via increased perception of the need for supply chain incentivization and improved communication quality enabled by BIM. Rolling out BIM on a wider scale may yield an additional benefit in lowering the barrier to the implementation of IPD systems.

However the literature published during 2015-2016 about the topic can be used to research the trend of implementation and cast some light over it. The objective of this study is to research only the literature using the methodology of Systematic Reviews. Blockchain (Pilkington 2015) has been one of the recent technological developments that is introducing radical change in the way we deal with assets interchange in digital economy (Nakamoto 2008). Either it be in the financial industry or more recently in encompassing manufacturing and supply chain (Abeyratne and Monfared 2016). However, all the actual hype about Blockchain technology, the fully operative projects are few, mainly in the financial industry with the Bitcoin flagship, and many more in pilot evaluations, in development or in conceptual consideration. Because of the distributed and cryptographic nature of their operation the implementation is not less free of challenges. One changing factor to the above is the fact companies like IBM are already introducing a “Blockchain foundational layer” (MENA Report 2016) for the implementation of projects. Besides the large IT groups, specialized companies providing solutions for Blockchain projects deployment (Mougayar 2015; L. Kemp 2017) are emerging out of the earlier implementations of digital currency systems. Being this technology (P. Satyavolu 2016) a data structure supported by a distributed data base where linked transactions are recorded as a chain of blocks not possible to tamper with, making it possible to create, access and share a digital ledger in a secure way without resourcing to a central trust authority. Adoption in the financial industry is now being followed by considering the application of this technology to the supply chain, with references starting in 2015. Where payments, smart contracts, and assets transactions of different types from manufacturing to sale can be tracked reducing time delays, human errors and costs associated.

The Top Four management consulting companies (Deloitte 2016; EY 2016; PwC 2016; Accenture 2016) are already including in their latest foresight publications the Blockchain in the list of future technologies to watch for financial, healthcare, law, government, industry and logistics. Price Waterhouse Cooper in a recent publication “Shifting patterns: The Future of the Logistics Industry” (2016), refers to the Blockchain technology as enhancing security of the supply chain, reducing bottlenecks, reducing errors and increasing efficiency. On the other hand it considers as uncertain, the rate of adoption and the emergence of one or several competing solutions. The early adoption phase of implementations, none earlier than 2015, and the growing attention from industry, academy and research, still does not provide a sound foundation on the issues, methods, findings and direction of the Blockchain-Supply Chain solutions. This poses the need to understand the current state of the implementation and research from the perspective of answering some questions about the early adoption. The questions of interest are related to; the type and volume of publications since 2015, the topics and issues addressed, the industrial sector intended, and the countries involved. The research method adopted is based on Systematic Reviews (Petticrew and Roberts 2006) which is supported by evaluating and interpreting available relevant literature in relation to a particular topic using categorical analysis This review can provide convenient summaries on a particular issue and answers to questions characterising the topic of interest (Barnett-Page and Thomas 2009b). This research approach, normally associated with healthcare analysis and social sciences, is beginning to be used to analyse the Blockchain adoption (Oshodin, Molla, and Ong 2016) in different possible sectors, allowing to research the published results during an observational period systematically. The research is supported by a special software tool for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis. The tool used is EPPI-Review-4 (Thomas and Harden 2008) developed by the Department of Social Science University College London (UCL) The study in this work requires as a first step to populate a data base of relevant literature for the period 2015-2016 from appropriate Publications Data Bases (Dickersin, Scherer, and Lefebvre 1994). The information to be collected includes citation information, publication abstract and full text document in pdf format (when possible). Following the creation of the relevant literature data base, the categorical codes and its hierarchy for the analysis have to be defined. The next step is the systematic analysis with the help of EPPI. The final result is a categorical multiple classification of the information, including coding part of the text in the document, allowing frequency analysis, crosstabs analysis and summary reports. The analysis can be extended to cover 3 other research interest, providing information is available in the Data Base (Barnett-Page and Thomas 2009a).

This paper presents an addition to the FIP toolbox that helps characterise and demarcate boundaries of emerging fields to allow for deeper analysis through other FIP methods. We illustrate this approach through an exercise for 3D printing technology (also known as Additive Manufacturing). We show that 3D printing can be represented by a dominant design: a tri-partite configuration of printer, material and digital design software. In the past decade we have seen significant branching from applications in rapid-prototyping to medical, fashion, aeronautics and supply chain management with a variety of elements coming together in tri-partite configurations. The paper adds to the current FTA literature an approach building on evolutionary theories of technical change to help with such situations – emerging, evolving and branching ‘innovation pathways’.

Blockchain, a new technology that enables different parties along a supply chain to trust digital data (it is sometimes called a 'trustless' technology), has the potential to lower transaction costs and improve the efficiency of agricultural supply chains by reducing the need for monitoring and verification of data. Yet while hugely promising, the technology is still new and experimental, and faces a number of significant barriers to adoption. 1 Blockchain: The latest agricultural technology? Agriculture is the original transformative human technology. The Neolithic agricultural revolution gave us towns and cities, and in the 1700s the British agricultural revolution ignited the industrial revolution (Russell 1966). Agriculture is itself an evolving technology through experimental discovery of what plants and animals thrive where and with what support. Australian commercial agriculture, for instance, is based on crop and livestock species introduced from elsewhere. But technology is also applied to agriculture. The invention of tools such as the seed-drill, steel plough, and mechanical harvesters, to improved practices such as rotational cropping and animal husbandry, to modern scientific breeding and engineering of plant and animal varietals conducted by specialized research institutes (Griliches 1957, Pardey et al 2010, Potts and Kastelle 2017) have all boosted agricultural productivity.

Abstract Purpose-Although supply chain management is now an established field, the distinction between supply chains and supply networks is relatively immature and requires further investigation. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the distinction between supply chains and supply networks. Design/methodology/approach-Based on a review of the literature and assisted by input from academic experts during a relevant supply chain management workshop, this paper critiques seminal and extant theoretical developments in the field of supply chain management. Findings-The main contribution of this paper is the development of an outline classification of relevant dimensions where the concepts of supply chain and supply network are compared and their distinctive features are highlighted. The paper identifies strategic opportunities emanating from considering both the supply chain and supply network, and the associated levels of engagement with active and inactive members in terms of, inter alia, complexity, members' interdependencies and risk resilience. Originality/value-The paper highlights many theoretical and practical implications following a detailed analysis of an engagement-based portfolio of relationships within complex supply systems. The systematic clarification of these two concepts and their boundaries result in the provision of original insights which will assist the future research agenda of the academic community."

Rapidly growing small business segment could not be served effectively through the traditional supply chain. Herman Miller found itself shackled by the traditional supply chain, and many firms remain in that predicament. In 1995, the company created a new operating unit called SQA for Simple, Quick, Affordable. The entrepreneurial team leading SQA reinvented its supply chain around product simplicity, convenient ordering, mass-customization, a very fast order-to-installation cycle, and extremely reliable delivery. SQA managers examined the entire set of activities involved: customer contact to order entry; order entry to shipment; and shipment to installation. Research by Mercer Management Consulting identified 30 companies in the Americas, Europe, and Asia as the best example of supply chain innovation.

The blockchain is an immutable and transparent distributed database, a ledger which has global consensus by all participants. This means that the things written in the ledger can't be edited and cheated, thus trusted if the writer is trusted. The supply chains for commercial markets are opaque and complex, they can span over hundreds of production stages and several geographical locations so that the provenance and history of a product is usually unknown to upstream actors. Lack of transparency and trust in the supply chain lead to lack of information about the provenance and working conditions behind the product. There has been shown that some actors behave illegally and unethically. This thesis' research purpose is to investigate the nature of trust in supply chains and if blockchain technologies can increase trust in supply chains. A theoretical framework involving trust and transparency in supply chains, blockchain and record keeping has been established. Blockchain has its strengths and limitations: high integrity but unstable information reliability. How data is recorded on the blockchain is considered critical and require a trusted third party recording transactions to guarantee information reliability. The authors believes that if the problem of information reliability is solved, trust in blockchain implementations will increase. The actors in the supply chain need an incentive and clear profit in order to have any motivation to implement the blockchain technology. A strong incentive and a method and specific steps for implementation still remains to be researched. Abstract 1 Table of contents 2 Acknowledgements 4"

The presented case study aims to develop insights into the impact of BIM on collaboration in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. A critical realist perspective was adopted and a systematic combining approach was employed to support data collection and analysis. Data were collected through a longitudinal case study of a large design–build project in Canada. The unit of analysis was the individual project team member. Five cognitive determinants identified from the analysis are seen to inform an individual’s framing of event patterns in the context of BIM-enabled collaboration: requirements, expectations, intentions, incentives and capabilities. From this perspective, the impact of BIM on collaboration is understood as a reshaping of an individual’s cognitive determinants, which influence a team member’s framing of event patterns enacted throughout project delivery. This shift is manifested by changing information landscapes, i.e. sources and flows of information, that are generated, shared and consumed within the project team."

Through adding the appropriate weighted threshold voltage variation from the pMOS (Δ VTHP) and the nMOS (Δ VTHN) diodes to the reference voltage of a high-speed low-dropout voltage regulator, the supply of the digital circuit becomes adaptive, and hence, it minimizes the speed deviation in the context of PVT variations. Validated in a UMC 65-nm CMOS process, the simulation and the measurement results of an inverter chain-based oscillator have validated the effectiveness of PVTCS. It can significantly reduce the delay variations with respect to the uncompensated supply counterpart. The same goes for a sample critical path-based oscillator with extensive simulation results. Therefore, the proposed circuit is useful for the digital point-of-load application, with the key technical merit of PVT compensation without encountering the potential latch-up problem from the reported methods."

Alternatively, in this study, inkjet-printed RDLs were introduced for FOWLP. In contrast to a subtractive method (e.g., photolithography), additive manufacturing techniques allow depositing the material only where it is desired. In the current study, RDL structures for different embedded modules were realized by inkjet printing and further characterized by electrical examinations. It was proposed that a digital printing process can be a more efficient and lower-cost solution especially for rapid prototyping of RDLs, since several production steps will be skipped, less material will be wasted and the supply chain will be shortened."

To illustrate, the agency model utilized by the e-book publishing industry has recently received much negative attention brought by the U.S. Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Apple, Inc. The emerging agency model in the e-book industry works as follows: the publisher sets the price of the digital goods and the retailers who serve as agents retain a percentage of the revenue associated with the consumer purchase. The regulators claim that the agency model is hurting this industry as well as the consumer’s welfare because e-book prices have increased after the introduction of agency model. We investigate the strategic impact of the agency model by studying a digital goods supply chain with one supplier and two competing retailers. In comparison to the benchmark wholesale model, we find that the agency model can coordinate the competing retailers by dividing the coordinated profits in a pre-negotiated revenue sharing proportion. Further, we also identify the Pareto improving region whereby both supplier and retailers prefer the agency model to the wholesale model and earn a higher profit as compared to the wholesale model. Thus, contrary to current press presaging the negative impact of the agency model on the e-books industry, we find the agency model to be superior to traditional wholesale contracts for publishers, retailers and consumers in this digital goods industry."

The research comprises a first, systematic analysis about the impact of AM on the network structures in engineer-to-order supply chains. Research Approach: The paper pursues an inductive research approach. Building on contingency theory as well as on general systems theory, and using extensive case studies from the medical industry, the implications of AM technology adoption on supply chain configurations are explored. The scope of the supply chains considered during the empirical analysis encompasses suppliers (i.e. material or machine suppliers), the focal firms (i.e. medical device manufacturers), and their customers (i.e. business customers and consumers). The qualitative investigations focus on the potential effects on the composition of the supply chain members, the structural dimensions of the network, as well as the different types of business process links across the supply chain. Contingency variables are identified, which constitute the context of supply chain configuration. Findings and Originality: The findings underpin that AM can be regarded as a technological driver for SCM. It is shown how AM technology adoption in engineer-to-order production may impact the network structure of supply chains. Not only the composition of the supply chain members and the structural dimensions of the network are likely to be altered due to AM technology usage, but also the types of business process links among the different agents. The research suggests that the effects of AM on supply chain configuration are context-dependent, with endogenous and supply chain- related factors being relevant groups of contingency factors. Research Impact: The study provides novel insights in the supply chain implications of AM, a still widely unexplored research field. It constructs a conceptual framework, which visualizes different context-dependent deployment alternatives for AM in engineer-to-order supply chains. Practical Impact: The findings could influence managerial decision-making concerning new manufacturing processes. Companies should be aware that switching to AM may create a need to reconsider the design and the firm’s positioning within the supply chain."

One of the unique elements of the blockchain technology that made it such a captivating technology to researchers is its plethora of features. Some of the features include smart contracts, cryptocurrency and tokenizing, immutable distributed ledger, cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. In addition, there are multiple types of blockchains, such as permissioned/private and permissionless/public, and various consensus models, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-stake.

With vinyl, the new/old dichotomy informs a more specific opposition between digital and analog. The vinyl record is an iconic analog artifact whose physical creation and circulation cannot be digitized. Making records involves arduous craft labor and old-school manufacturing, and the process remains essentially the same as it was in 1960. Vinyl culture and commerce today, however, abound with digital media: the majority of vinyl sales occur online, the download code is a familiar feature of new vinyl releases, and turntables outfitted with USB ports and Bluetooth are outselling traditional models. This digital disconnect between the contemporary traffic in records and their fabrication makes the vinyl revival an ideal case example for interrogating the limitations of new and old as conceptual horizons for media and for proffering alternative historical formulations and critical frameworks. Toward that end, my analysis of the revitalized vinyl economy in the United States suggests that the familiar (and always porous) distinction between corporate and independent continues to offer media studies a more salient spectrum, conceptually and empirically, than new-old or analog-digital. Drawing on ethnographic research along vinyl’s current supply chain in the United States, I argue that scholars and supporters of independent culture should strive to decouple the digital and the analog from the corporate, rather than from one another. The pressing question about the future of vinyl is not, will there continue to be a place for analog formats alongside the digital; but rather, to what extent can physical media circulate independently of the same corporate interests that have come to dominate popular culture in its digital forms?"

More specifically, as enabling IT technologies (IoT, smart sensors, etc.) enlarge the focus of analysis from the unit level to the entire plant or even to the supply chain level, the existence of relevant dynamics at multiple scales becomes a common pattern; therefore, multiscale methods are called for and must be applied in order to avoid biased analysis towards a certain scale, compromising the benefits from the balanced exploitation of the information content at all scales. Also, these same enabling technologies currently collect large volumes of data at high-sampling rates, creating a flood of digital information that needs to be properly handled; optimal data aggregation provides an efficient solution to this challenge, leading to the emergence of multi-granularity frameworks.

Essentially, it is lost before it even reaches the end consumer. Conventional methods of food waste tracking relying on paper-based logs to collect and analyse the data are costly, laborious, and time-consuming. Hence, an automated and real-time system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) concepts is proposed to measure the overall amount of waste as well as the reasons for waste generation in real-time within the potato processing industry, by using modern image processing and load cell technologies. The images captured through a specially positioned camera are processed to identify the damaged, unusable potatoes, and a digital load cell is used to measure their weight. Subsequently, a deep learning architecture, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is utilised to determine a potential reason for the potato waste generation. An accuracy of 99.79% was achieved using a small set of samples during the training test. We were successful enough to achieve a training accuracy of 94.06%, a validation accuracy of 85%, and a test accuracy of 83.3% after parameter tuning. This still represents a significant improvement over manual monitoring and extraction of waste within a potato processing line. In addition, the real-time data generated by this system help actors in the production, transportation, and processing of potatoes to determine various causes of waste generation and aid in the implementation of corrective actions."

As labor costs are high, several industries have suffered severely under the relocation of production facilities towards aspiring countries, which have managed to close the productivity and quality gap substantially. Established manufacturing companies have recognized that customers are not willing to pay large price premiums for incremental quality improvements. As a consequence, many companies from the German manufacturing industry adjust their production focusing on customized products and fast time to market. Leveraging the advantages of novel production strategies such as Agile Manufacturing and Mass Customization, manufacturing companies transform into integrated networks, in which companies unite their core competencies. Hereby, virtualization of the process- and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating entities. Boundaries of companies deteriorate, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. By including Cyber-Physical- Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-topics into the respective research field. To assess the practical implications, we conducted face-to-face interviews with managers from the industry as well as from the consulting business using a structured interview guideline. The results reveal reasons for the adaption and refusal of Industry 4.0 practices from a managerial point of view. Our findings contribute to the upcoming research stream of Industry 4.0 and support decision- makers to assess their need for transformation towards Industry 4.0 practices."

But the broader agri-food system also expands, and the scope for agriculture-related job creation shifts beyond the farm. Historically, technological revolutions have shaped, and have been shaped by, these dynamics. Today, a digital revolution is taking hold. In this process of structural transformation, societies evolve from having a surplus to a shortage of domestic farm labor, typically met by foreign agricultural wage workers. Yet anti-immigration sentiments are flying high in migrant-destination countries, and agricultural trade may be similarly challenged. Robots in the fields and packing plants offer an alternative to a diminishing labor supply. COVID-19 will reinforce trends of digitization and anti-globalization (including in food trade), while slowing economic growth and structural transformation. In the world's poorest countries, particularly in Africa, labor productivity in agriculture remains at historically low levels. So, what role can the agri-food system play as a source of employment in the future? This viewpoint elaborates on these trends and reviews several policy options, including inclusive value chain development, better immigration policies, social insurance schemes, and ramp up in agricultural education and extension."

Firms that manage both traditional and digital goods distribution channels are facing many emerging operational challenges. One of the most pivotal problems for these media related industries concerns the supply chain contract model utilized for the distribution of digital goods alongside their traditional counterparts. Recently, the agency model exploited by publishers in the e-book industry has been highlighted in the press as a result of the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) lawsuit against Apple, Inc. Chief amongst the DOJ regulators’ complaints was that e-book prices increased and consumer surplus decreased as a direct result of the agency model. We investigate the strategic impact of the agency model in comparison with the prevalent wholesale and fixed price models by formulating a dual channel model of distribution accommodating sales of both traditional and digital goods. In contrast to the current press concerning the DOJ’s lawsuit, we find that the equilibrium price of digital goods is lower in the agency model than in the conventional wholesale model. Furthermore, the agency model can increase firm’s profit as well as consumer surplus by mitigating the double marginalization effect within the digital goods supply chain. Finally, we also conceptualize the similarity and differences between the agency model and revenue sharing contracts."

Large cities with population greater than 750,000 would represent US$21.8 trillion in economic activity or 47.7% global GDP. These cities are already home to 1.7 billion people, about 24% of the world’s population. By the year 2050, it is expected that ninety percent of the world’s urban population growth will occur in Asia and Africa. Economic growth goes hand-in-hand with the urban growth. With the population increase in cities, there is a need for ample and consistent supply of water. The supply of water is a fundamental component of the environmental, economic and social health of cities. There is a huge investment of US$90 billion a year in water supply infrastructure to ensure delivery of clean water to the citizens. If the current trend continues, the volume of urban water need will have to go up by 80% by the year 2030. In this context, The World Economic Forum classified water security as one of the greatest threats to global prosperity in the year 2014. Hence, it becomes essential to manage the water resources in an efficient manner to cater to a large population. The world around us is transformed by various technologies and adopted by humans. Improvement in the performance and cost of computing power, storage and bandwidth are the causes of these technologies. Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies like Virtual & Augmented Reality, Big Data Analytics, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Block Chain have created disruption in various industries through the way businesses are run. India as a country has an advantage of monetising digital technologies for solutions related to social issues due to STEM qualified expertise and experience. AI4SG has got the potential to provide the most sought after Water Security for a country like India. The current study attempts to identify whether there is a dearth in the supply of water due to lack of rain or excess exploitation; or is it that the resources are available but the management of water resources is not efficient. State-wise analysis across India is conducted to identify the gap. The measure used for this study is the Composite Water Quality Index devised by Niti Aayog. The study has found that the gap between supply and demand of this significant resource can be bridged with the proven technology of Block Chain. Issue of Water loss, Water trading and Water quality could be resolved using Block Chain technology. The most common areas of improvement in Water management across various States of India are Water supply, Ground water restoration/rejuvenation, Participatory Irrigation, On-farm use, and Waste water treatment.

Like early 20th century U.S. manufacturers who paid women working from home by the piece (Boris 1994), technology industrialists pay dispersed humans along the data supply chain by completion of a task rather than by the hour (Irani 2015). This unregulated work, which machines cannot perform, forms the building blocks of advancements in automation and artificial intelligence. How do today’s digital homeworkers conceive of and experience time in the context of this piecework? Examining narratives of U.S.-based AMT data processors through a historical frame, I argue that although contemporary digital pieceworkers are ostensibly working “on their ‘own’ time,” a temporal politics emerges in which time, visible and accounted for in wage work, becomes an invisible node of power (Sharma 2014). This disciplinary power both mediates the lives of precarious digital pieceworkers and fuels the frenetic pace of technology capitalism.

Theoretically, we offer an understanding of the economic flow, stress the optimization of construction logistics through flow integration, analyse current approaches to understanding blockchain, adopt sociomateriality to envision a suitable blockchain solution, and consider the way blockchain can constitute part of the value proposition of a related digital business model. Methodologically, we systematically reviewed the literature on blockchain-related construction research, and conducted empirical studies on independent logistics consultants in the Swedish context for more than a year. On the one hand, the literature review reveals that core blockchain properties can generate value for construction logistics (e.g. shared ledger structure and reduction of accounting rework) – however, apart from visions and prototypes, there currently exist no use cases, and potential implementational constraints and security issues are limitedly considered. One the other hand, the empirical findings show that independent construction logistics consultants in the sociomaterial Swedish context are suitable candidates for the proposed digital business model. By combining the literature and empirical insights, a permissioned private proof-of-authority blockchain solution integrating the supply chain flows in a generic sociomaterial setting is conceptualized. This solution is then embedded in the value proposition of a digital business model for an independent construction logistics consultant. The proposition includes, among others, improved process management and increased productivity, while the consultants’ competitive advantage through innovation is facilitated. Other business model segments, like key resources, are also updated via the blockchain solution, while some, like channels, are not significantly affected. To not hinder the realization of this digital business model, issues like the lack of blockchain awareness, and the existing power balances within sociomaterial constellations, have to be addressed."

The aim of the work is to study and summarize the main problems of pharmaceutical logistics in a coronavirus pandemic and substantiate the reserves to improve the functioning of pharmaceutical supply chains. To achieve the goal of the study, an analysis of the domestic scientific literature and the current regulatory framework of Ukraine was conducted. It has used abstract-logical, monographic research methods and system analysis, as well as the method of expert survey. Realizing the importance of providing the population with necessary medicines during the pandemic in Ukraine on October 14, 2020, the Law «Changes to the article 19 of the Law of Ukraine ""On Medicinal Products"" on Electronic Retail Trade in Medicines» of September 17, 2020 № 904-IX has enforced. It has been evaluated the factors influencing the efficiency and coordination of the activities of pharmaceutical supply chain participants. A risk management algorithm for pharmaceutical supply chains has been developed, its structural elements and relationships have been identified. The presented algorithm will allow analyzing and estimating any deviations from the planned parameters in pharmaceutical supply chains on the basis of establishment of system of the corresponding indicators and on the basis of this information to define effective methods to counter the risks. The urgency of the problem of increasing the reliability and safety of domestic pharmaceutical supply chains in a pandemic has proved. It is justified that the introduction of digital technologies will increase the reliability, transparency and quality of business processes in the pharmaceutical supply chains during a pandemic, drastic changes in the pharmaceutical market and low predictability of demand for medicines and medical devices. The main problems of logistics in a pandemic in the domestic pharmaceutical industry are studied. It has established that the narrowest places in the organization of pharmaceutical supply chains are the improper organization of information exchange between pharmaceutical supply chain participants and the insufficient professional level of production interaction of managers. It has established the priority directions of increase of stability and reliability of functioning of pharmaceutical supply chains which is a necessary condition of accessibility of pharmaceutical provision of the population, especially in the conditions of a pandemic."

Berdasarkan hal tersebut, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengidentifikasi berbagai permasalahan dan kendala dengan menggunakan pendekatan yang bersifat holistik dan partisipatif. Proses analisis dimulai dengan memvisualisasikan Big Picture Mapping pada proses produksi hulu hingga hilir untuk mengidentifikasi permasalahan dan kendala memalui proses dialog dan diskusi sepanjang rantai pasok pertanian berdasarkan konsep value co-creation. Pendekatan yang digunakan untuk menggali informasi yaitu dengan metode participatory action research yang melibatkan partisipasi dari peneliti, praktisi dan pemangku kebijakan sektor pertanian. Sektor pertanian di Provinsi Jawa Barat menjadi studi kasus pada penelitian ini. Pelibatan aktor dari sektor pertanian, peternakan, perikanan, dan perkebunan, pelaku pasar dan pemerintah menjadi dasar pengembangan model smart supply chain pada sektor pertnian. Penelitian ini menunjukan bahwa permasalahan yang terjadi pada sektor pertanian dikarenakan tidak ada integrasi antar pelaku rantai pasok serta para pemangku kepentingan (pemerintah, pihak swasta, dan peneliti) sehingga kegiatan pembangunan dijalankan secara terpisah dan tidak dikoordinasikan dengan tepat. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, rekomendasi pengembangan pembangunan sektor pertanian dengan pengembangan smart supply chain harus dilandasi oleh koordinasi antar aktor yang dilakukan secara terintegrasi. Komponen utama pengembangan smart supply chain sektor pertanian harus melibatkan klaster, simpul pangan, dan pengembangan berbagai teknologi digital yang tepat guna.   Agriculture is one of the economic sectors contributing to the country's GDP. Various potentials and diversity of the agricultural sector become the potential strength to be developed sustainably. However, the potential and diversity of these resources still face various obstacles and problems, such as climate, production, post-harvest, and marketing. According to this case, this study aims to identify various problems and obstacles using a holistic and participatory approach. The analysis process begins by visualizing the Big Picture Mapping in the upstream to downstream production processes to identify problems and obstacles through a process of dialogue and discussion throughout the agricultural supply chain based on the value co-creation concept. The approach used to dig up information is by using participatory action research methods that involve participation from researchers, practitioners and stakeholders in the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector in West Java Province is a case study in this research. The involvement of actors from the agricultural, livestock, fisheries and plantation sectors, market players and the government is the basis for developing the agricultural smart supply chain model. This research shows that the problems that occur in the agricultural sector are due to the lack of integration between supply chain actors and stakeholders (i.e., government, private sector, and researchers). The development activities are carried out separately and are not appropriately coordinated. Based on this case, recommendations for developing the agricultural sector with the development of smart supply chains must be based on coordination between actors carried out in an integrated manner. The main components of agricultural smart supply chain development should involve clusters, food hubs, and the development of various appropriate digital technologies."

According to a new McKinsey Global Survey of executives, 1 their companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. And the share of digital or digitally enabled products in their portfolios has accelerated by a shocking seven years. 2 Nearly all respondents say that their companies have stood up at least temporary solutions to meet many of the new demands on them, and much more quickly than they had thought possible before the crisis. What's more, respondents expect most of these changes to be long lasting and are already making the kinds of investments that all but ensure they will stick. In fact, when we asked executives about the impact of the crisis on a range of measures, they say that funding for digital initiatives has increased more than anything else-more than increases in costs, the number of people in technology roles, and the number of customers. To stay competitive in this new business and economic environment requires new strategies and practices. 3 Our findings suggest that executives are taking note: most respondents recognize technology's strategic importance as a critical component of the business, not just a source of cost efficiencies. Respondents from the companies that have executed successful responses to the crisis report a range of technology capabilities that others don't-most notably, filling gaps for technology talent during the crisis, the use of more advanced technologies, and speed in experimenting and innovating. 4 Digital adoption has taken a quantum leap at both the organizational and industry levels During the pandemic, consumers have moved dramatically toward online channels, 5 and companies and industries have responded in turn. The survey results confirm the rapid shift toward interacting with customers through digital channels. They also show that rates of adoption are years ahead of where they were when previous surveys were conducted-and even more in developed Asia than in other regions (Exhibit 1). Respondents are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that at least 80 percent of their customer interactions are digital in nature. Perhaps more surprising is the speedup in creating digital or digitally enhanced offerings. Across regions, the results suggest a seven-year increase, on average, in the rate at which companies are developing these products and services. Once again, the leap is even greater-ten years-in developed Asia (Exhibit 2). Respondents also report a similar mix of types of digital products in their portfolios before and during the pandemic. This finding suggests that during the crisis, companies have probably refocused their offerings rather than made huge leaps in product development in the span of a few months. Across sectors, the results suggest that rates for developing digital products during the pandemic differ. Given the time frames for making manufacturing changes, the differences, not surprisingly, are more apparent between sectors with and without physical products than between B2B and B2C companies. Respondents in consumer 1 The online survey was in the field from July 7 to July 31, 2020, and garnered responses from 899 C-level executives and senior managers representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, and functional specialties. 2 We looked at the past results for the degree of digital adoption reported in each of these areas of business operations. Based on the average percentage of adoption in each survey, we calculated a trendline to represent the average rate of adoption in 2017, 2018, and just before the crisis, which respondents were asked about in the 2020 survey. The acceleration time frame was calculated from the amount of time it would have taken to reach the current level of digital adoption respondents report if the precrisis pace of change had continued."

The methodological basis relies on the provisions of the theory of logistic management including the issues of interfirm and interorganizational interaction that is formed under the influence of the evolutionary factor of logistic integration. The data of the expert survey and analysis of aggregated indicators of logistic intersystem entities functioning in the Russian Federation help to identify the most integrated intersystem logistic entities. The Digital Transformation Index developed by foreign researchers and adjusted to the Russian practice allows us to investigate the depth of logistic integration and the level of digitalization of interorganizational logistic entities. The authors establish that there is an interrelation between the stages of logistic integration evolution and the development of forms of intersystem (interorganizational) logistic entities. The paper proposes a method for evaluating the depth of logistic integration and provides the estimates of this indicator and reference values for the levels of management digitalization for intersystem logistic entities typical of the Russian reality.

We suggest that a better way of dealing with piracy is an economic solution, such as neutralizing piracy by reengineering the supply chain across all three sectors of the motion picture industry: distribution, exhibition, production. In distribution, the industry can make legitimate downloading of high-quality movie files easier and cheaper (than pirating) by strategically locating ""e-Blockbusters"" (i.e., digital movie libraries) at or near Internet service provider (ISP) sites and making them attractive through feasible pricing schemes. In exhibition, innovative digital theaters could offer virtual reality viewing experiences and flexible windowing systems that maximize revenue for each feature film. In production, work would be done primarily or entirely in the digital domain. Digital film reservoirs would provide universal naming and indexing functions for easy access, reuse, and extension, and the industry would achieve a new diversity of quality and quantity. In addition, dynamic cross-media convergence can be expected as a function of the complementarities created by content digitization. To prosper in the new digital economy, the motion picture industry must closely collaborate with the information industry to achieve a new supply chain rather than competing with it to the detriment of both. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

The objective of the paper was to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of BCT in agri-food supply chains in the areas related to ensuring the safety and quality of food products. While assessing the potential of this technology, there were considered both the applications described in the reference literature and the effects of the selected pilot and demonstration projects, in which the BCTbased solutions and applications were tested. The analysis performed makes it possible to draw a conclusion that BCT can play a positive role in ensuring food safety and quality. The basic benefit of using this technology is the increased transparency of agri-food supply chain functioning. The BCT-based applications enable to improve the efficiency of tracking, tracing, and identifying agri-food products in the supply chain. As a result, the number of food adulteration cases could be reduced as well as the number of cases of unauthorized use of food quality certificates. However, there are also certain risks and problems associated with the use of BCT. BCT has not yet reached its full technological maturity-the scalability of BCT may prove to be a problem in more developed and complex supply chains involving multi-component products. Also, social, economic, legal, and financial barriers should be pointed out for they might have adverse effects on the prospects for the wider use of BCT in agri-food supply chains. Therefore, though the agri-food enterprises are more and more interested in practical use of BCT, the implementation of BCT in agri-food supply chains is likely to be relatively slow. © 2018, Polskie Towarzystwo Technologow Zywnosci Wydawnictwo Naukowe PTTZ.

On the other side, we are witnessing new developments in logistics service providers and their transformation. Competitiveness today doesn’t depend only on price but also on customer service and delivery time. This can be influenced by the implementation of modern methods in logistics. Thus, logistics service providers in the global market are looked at as business partners and the relationship with logistics service company is considered as a partnership. Because of the development in technology e-logistics concept has become more frequently used since it gives concepts for information sharing and information transparency within partners within supply chains. Thus, one of the important tasks of e-logistics is to share information with its partners and with that, it can have an influence on their competitiveness. The main aim of the paper is to show that the right logistics service provider in the modern supply chain can help companies to gain and maintain competitiveness and especially by using different modern digital tools in doing business. Methods: Paper has been written based on the analyses of the reviewed literature together with determining potential influence e-logistics and e-SCM have on company’s competitiveness. The case of DHL included in this study has been selected to present potentials which e-logistics have on creating a competitive advantage. Results: Research results show that use of advanced logistics operator can help companies in increasing their competitiveness in today’s market Conclusions: Customer experience, new entrants, technology collaboration vs. competition are major characteristics of the new trend and logistics service providers will need to adapt to these changes. Improved running in one of the previously mentioned areas will create and maintain the company’s competitiveness and as more modern technological tools and solutions will be used, companies will be able to have more benefits."

An ongoing debate on CBDM in the research community revolves around several aspects such as definitions, key characteristics, computing architectures, communication and collaboration processes, crowdsourcing processes, information and communication infrastructure, programming models, data storage, and new business models pertaining to CBDM. One question, in particular, has often been raised: is cloud-based design and manufacturing actually a new paradigm, or is it just ""old wine in new bottles""? To answer this question, we discuss and compare the existing definitions for CBDM, identify the essential characteristics of CBDM, define a systematic requirements checklist that an idealized CBDM system should satisfy, and compare CBDM to other relevant but more traditional collaborative design and distributed manufacturing systems such as web- and agent-based design and manufacturing systems. To justify the conclusion that CBDM can be considered as a new paradigm that is anticipated to drive digital manufacturing and design innovation, we present the development of a smart delivery drone as an idealized CBDM example scenario and propose a corresponding CBDM system architecture that incorporates CBDM-based design processes, integrated manufacturing services, information and supply chain management in a holistic sense. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This research explores future value network configurations which, when aligned with disruptive shifts in technology (process and digital), may enable alternative routes to medicines production and the delivery of additional value to ‘end-users’, i.e. patients and health care providers. We draw on a categorisation of AMTs that may enable a shift from the traditional ‘batch’ and centralised manufacturing paradigm of ‘make-to-stock’, towards more re-distributed ‘continuous’ manufacturing and ‘make-to-order’ models. Despite reported benefits in the academic literature (e.g. reduced footprints, improved quality, enhanced flexibility and inventory savings), current adoption rates of continuous technologies in this sector remain low (c. 5%). This paper presents new data sources, in our study of AMT adoption in a global pharmaceutical context–assessing the barriers to implementation, and the pathways to delivering future continuous manufacturing scenarios.

However, an important factor that affects the benefits obtained by growers is the supply chain structure that results from the introduction of the online platform. In this paper, we provide a case study of an online coffee auction established in India for selling various grades of coffee beans. The focus of the case study is on the supply chain structure that is likely to evolve under various product and supplier characteristics. We argue that the online direct selling of commodities by growers is likely to evolve only under a certain set of conditions.

One type of firm that is particularly well positioned to drive this transition are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who design and produce capital goods. In this paper we propose that the OEM acts as an intellectual property (IP) licensor by selling spare parts designs, rather than physical spare parts. With these designs a buyer can print spare parts locally at much shorter lead times and at lower setup costs. We consider both an OEM who serves multiple identical buyers, and an OEM who serves two non-identical buyers. For both cases we characterize the optimal IP license contract. This determines which customers opt for the IP license channel and which remain in the traditional centralized sales channel, thus creating insights into the degree to which a supply chain decentralizes. We numerically show this to occur in a surprisingly large number of cases and we observe significant profit increases for OEMs who adopt this new business model. Our results thus show that IP licensing by OEMs can become a major enabler in the transition to digital networks with decentralized 3D printing."

However, the differences in the priorities of the lean and agile paradigms multiply the challenges in lean and agile combinations. The most discussed approaches in the literature are the decoupling point and the late customisation (postponement) strategies. Supply chain visibility as a solution is less frequently discussed though the ‘Smarter Supply Chain of the Future’ report states that ‘70% of supply chain leaders view Supply Chain Visibility as their number one challenge ... the need to ‘see’ and act on the right information’ (IBM, 2010). Technologies such as EDI and RFID have been implemented to improve visibility, have not gained general acceptance. Newer, low cost ‘Cloud’ solutions may be able to address the need better. Previous research has suggested that increasing information visibility improves supply chain performance, though the relationship between the degree of visibility and resulting performance does not appear to have been addressed. Therefore, a role playing simulation methodology was devised to evaluate the effect of supply chain visibility on improved LeAgile supply chain performance. Role playing simulations better emulate the human control actions in supply chains, but can also suffer/benefit from traits such as learning. A low cost Web and Cloud based system was devised to enable visibility and communication in the simulation. Different information sharing configurations (visibility levels) were evaluated for a typical four-echelon supply chain. The results show a correlation in improved supply chain LeAgility with the degree of visibility of demand and/or operational information, but this was not a linear relationship. A degree of ‘digital’ waste eroded performance with increasing levels of visibility. Comparison simulations were then conducted to compare the supply chain visibility strategy with ‘decoupling point’ and ‘postponement’ strategies for the same four-echelon supply chain. The results suggest that after adopting the supply chain visibility approach, the overall performance of the simulation supply chain increased by 26.3% and 26.4% compared to the decoupling point and postponement approach scenarios. Further simulation experiments with different supply chain configurations are required to test the wider applicability of the results."

Assuming that several product design alternatives are possible using PLM solutions, the design of the extended supply chain is achieved by levels corresponding to the product’s bill of material.

SCM in the digital age encompasses accessibility of internal activities and measurement metrics by external parties as well as optimization of processes for mutual improvement in customer service, and reduction of inventory level and associated cost; good business relationships built on trust and minimized selfishness; and long term flexibility and adaptability evidenced by co-creation of products along the value chain. Apparently, experience has shown too many firms avoid engagement in this extensive supply chain integration, perhaps for fear of breeding conflicts. The paper viewed the current practice of SCM by studying the experiences and insights of 108 managers/officers, drawn from eight indigenous firms. The benchmark for selection was that the subject must be directly involved in supply chain initiatives and case study interviews were used for the survey. The finding unravelled discrepancy between the ideals of theories of SCM and actual practice; no consensus about its meaning, multiple supply chain collaboration compounds the problem even the more, and most times it may be difficult to meet the laid down conditions. Firms easily embrace internal cross functional integration and shun inter-organizational integration, perhaps because they want to build unique competitive advantage. Therefore more orientations should be done to educate managers on the ideals of SCM, especially on the area of dissuading selfish maximization of profits."

Findings: The findings are threefold. First, empowerment capability and the information-sharing level are unique factors that affect SLEC's organizational collaboration. Second, greater empowerment capability stimulates the increase of information-sharing level. Third, emerging digital technology, personalized demand and peer competition affect the degree of SLEC's organizational collaboration through an intermediary variable – empowerment capability. Specifically, the emerging digital technology application and peer competition degrees have positive effects on empowerment capability, while the demand personalization degree negatively (positively) affects empowerment capability in the short (long) term. Originality/value: As an important part of supply chain performance, organizational collaboration is receiving more attention. However, in the smart economy context, no theoretical framework exists for analyzing factors that affect the organizational collaboration degree of SLEC. This study fills this gap."

This technology provides for the possibility to store information on transactions and products in a decentralized and scattered database that is tamperproof and not open to changes. The objective of the paper was to discuss the opportunities and challenges associated with the use of BCT in agri-food supply chains in the areas related to ensuring the safety and quality of food products. While assessing the potential of this technology, there were considered both the applications described in the reference literature and the effects of the selected pilot and demonstration projects, in which the BCTbased solutions and applications were tested. The analysis performed makes it possible to draw a conclusion that BCT can play a positive role in ensuring food safety and quality. The basic benefit of using this technology is the increased transparency of agri-food supply chain functioning. The BCT-based applications enable to improve the efficiency of tracking, tracing, and identifying agri-food products in the supply chain. As a result, the number of food adulteration cases could be reduced as well as the number of cases of unauthorized use of food quality certificates. However, there are also certain risks and problems associated with the use of BCT. BCT has not yet reached its full technological maturity-the scalability of BCT may prove to be a problem in more developed and complex supply chains involving multi-component products. Also, social, economic, legal, and financial barriers should be pointed out for they might have adverse effects on the prospects for the wider use of BCT in agri-food supply chains. Therefore, though the agri-food enterprises are more and more interested in practical use of BCT, the implementation of BCT in agri-food supply chains is likely to be relatively slow. © 2018, Polskie Towarzystwo Technologow Zywnosci Wydawnictwo Naukowe PTTZ.

Advanced IT systems have enhanced inventory and demand visibility, allowed for easy information exchange with customers, and facilitated communications with global partners. Transportation technologies have improved the speed and efficiency necessary to transport goods around the globe. However, dramatic changes in both of these areas are on the horizon. The emergence of new technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality, driverless transportation, drones, near field communications, and the Internet of Things will force the next big wave of changes in global supply chains. While many of these technologies have been adopted by individual firms, many questions remain concerning how these technologies will drive new supply chain policies, business models, and regulations in the future. To illustrate, while technologies such as driverless transportation and the Internet of Things facilitate supply chain efficiency and transparency, they also increase the risk of compromising data security for all parties involved. In this article, we offer a brief overview of each of these new technologies, and summarize the impact on the supply chain. We intend for this chapter to spur interest and research into not only these technologies and their impact on the supply chain, but also into envisioning the supply chains of the future."

In this paper, we propose a parameterized event algebra that defines the detailed semantics of composite event operators. We introduce composite event operators that support explicit parameters for event selection and event consumption. These parameters define how to handle duplicates in both primitive and composite events. The event algebra EVA forms the foundation for a unifying reference language that allows for translation between arbitrary event composition languages using transformation rules. This translation, in turn, enables a mediator service that can federate heterogeneous event-based systems. Our approach supports the seamless integration of event-based applications and changing event sources without the need to redefine user profiles. The event algebra is exemplified in the domain of transportation logistics."

A mining complex is a type of value chain whereby raw materials (minerals) extracted from various mineral deposits are transformed into a set of sellable products, using the available processing streams. The supply of materials extracted from a group of mines represents a major source of uncertainty in mining operations and mineral value chains. The simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes, presented herein, aims to address major limitations of past approaches by modelling and optimizing several interrelated aspects of the mineral value chain in a single model. This single optimization model integrates material extraction from a set of sources along with their uncertainty, the related risk management, blending, stockpiling, non-linear transformations that occur in the available processing streams, the utilization of processing streams, and, finally, the transportation of products to customers. Uncertainty in materials extracted from the related mineral deposits of a mining complex is represented by a group of stochastic simulations. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation for modelling and optimizing a mining complex, along with a metaheuristic-based solver that facilitates the practical optimization of exceptionally large mathematical formulations. The distinct advantages of the approach presented herein are demonstrated through two case studies, where the stochastic framework is compared to past approaches that ignore uncertainty. Results demonstrate major improvements in both meeting forecasted production targets and net present value. Concepts and methods presented in this paper for the simultaneous stochastic optimization for mining complexes may be adopted and applied to the optimization of smart oil fields."

Irrigation, therefore, has a crucial role in enhancing food security and reducing hunger in the region. Numerous countries in Africa consider water and irrigation management as a key factor in improving their food security and ensuring access to drinking-water for their populations. Fortunately, there is evidence from a number of places on the continent where the adoption of efficient irrigation systems has led to higher productivity among smallholder farmers. While the appropriate interventions for the diverse agro-ecological zones of sub-Saharan Africa are known, adoption among smallholder farmers still remains a challenge. Digital technology opens the vast untapped potential for farmers, investors, and entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of food production and consumption in Africa. From precision farming to an efficient food supply chain, technology could bring major economic, social, and environmental benefits. Increasing investment and involvement of the private sector is crucial for the up-scaling of irrigation technologies. Indeed, the sheer optimism across the startup ecosystem is that extreme hunger can be cured in Africa, in this generation, by significantly transforming the industry that employs most of its citizens. This paper draws on lessons from past trends in the irrigation industry and emphasizes on novel directions to ensure that farmers, as well as other stakeholders reap the benefits associated with improved technologies."

In the best of all worlds, this interactive flow of information among member firms will result in efficient and effective balance of supply and demand. Unfortunately, supply networks suffer from poor and inexact information, and, in the worst case, information is unavailable where and when it is needed. Such entropy creates errors and limits responsiveness of processes leading to situations where there is too much or too little inventory at a given stage in a supply network. These complications are exacerbated across transnational supply chain networks. This paper offers theoretical perspectives, a case study, and outline of a research proposal to help address these challenges and develop insights into the best practices of transnational digital supply networks. High level questions include: What are the defining characteristics of high performing digital supply networks? How does information sharing impact the error and responsiveness of supply network processes and, consequently, supply network performance? How do international outsourcing practices affect network outcomes? These questions are theoretically examined and used to formulate specific hypotheses. An initial investigation of this theoretical formulation is conducted using a case study approach of a global plastics supply network. We propose a program of follow-up empirical work based on a broad field study of high performing supply networks. After a rigorous process for developing the instrumentation through semi-structured interviews, we expect to gather information about over 300 network configurations. As initial empirical evidence for going beyond dyadic exploration of supply networks, we present a case analysis of a plastic industry supply network, the Omnexus electronic trading network. In this analysis, we show how network externalities lead to more efficient flows of information and to more dynamic responses. The overall performance of all firms participating in this network should be enhanced over time. The major contribution of these ongoing studies will be new theoretical and empirical insights into the pathologies and metabolism of global digital supply networks. Specifically, we intend to delineate externalities of supply networks that are not embraced by exclusively dyadic perspectives, as well as the salient factors that complicate the interaction of supply network behavior across national boundaries. We will develop, test and measure novel constructs such as networked organizational performance and error amplification, unveiling systematic knowledge about the relationships between these factors across socio-geographic regions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Counterfeit medicines are prevalent everywhere including in traditional healthcare settings, unregulated sectors, and on the Internet. These dangerous medicines are on the rise in both therapeutic and geographic scope, threatening patient lives, potentially leading to antimicrobial resistance, and profiting illicit criminal actors. Yet, despite these clear threats, surveillance is extremely limited, with available data pointing to an increasing global health crisis worldwide that has yet to be addressed. Efforts by a variety of international organizations have made inroads in combating this illicit trade, but are stymied by ineffectual governance. In this paper, I employ an interdisciplinary research approach to assess the policy environment for this global public health issue for both the physical and digital global drug supply chain. This is accomplished in the first chapter by conducting an analysis of current diplomatic and governance efforts to address the issue. Using analysis from the first chapter, I then formulate governance-based solutions for physical and digital distribution and sale of counterfeit drugs. The results of this research indicate that combating the global counterfeit medicines trade requires engagement, cooperation, and coordination among a wide array of public and private stakeholders. Governance solutions to address this issue must be inclusive and transparent with a focus on crime, public health, and patient safety. To address this global public health crisis, we recommend the establishment of an enhanced governance trilateral mechanism between UNODC-WHO-Interpol for the counterfeit drug trade and incorporating and partnering with existing Internet Governance mechanisms to combat the online trade of counterfeit medicines."

In the wake of Bitcoin’s success, the retail industry sees potential in using blockchain technology to tackle some of these challenges. While blockchain technology itself has been subject to extensive research lately, the intersection between blockchain technology and supply chain traceability is still rather unexplored. Since the industry wishes to better understand the benefits and limitations of the technology in their context, this study aims to guide businesses in this assessment. Purpose The purpose with this thesis is to develop a framework for evaluating the applicability of blockchain technology in supply chain management to improve traceability. Methodology A sequential method was used with three phases: 1) a literature review on existing theory which condensed to a theoretical model, 2) an interview study with experts in relevant fields to improve and adjust the model, and 3) an interview study with business representatives to validate the model and also to reach conclusions on the applicability of blockchain technology in this context. Conclusions The evaluation framework was successfully developed. In the evaluation, businesses first identify the drivers for traceability, and map the current traceability system to identify what improvements are needed to satisfy the driver. Secondly, key properties of blockchain technology are assessed, and a draft for an application is designed. Lastly, the drafted application is evaluated based on goal fulfilment, data requirements, degree of novelty and complexity of the application, and the inherent technical limitations of blockchains. Two hypothetical use-cases are presented in the study, and their limitations are discussed. The first case uses a blockchain for storing digital certificates of products to combat fraud, the second case uses a blockchain for storing the same type of traceability data as the companies store right now, only in a distributed fashion. While some properties of blockchain technology are aligned with some of the core concepts of successful traceability, it is still difficult to pinpoint exactly how blockchain technology should be used to effectively improve traceability."

Two authors independently screened search outputs, reviewed full texts of potentially eligible articles, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data; resolving disagreements through consensus. Four studies met our inclusion criteria (three before–after studies and one randomized trial). Three studies were conducted in low- and middle-income countries while one was conducted in Canada (a high-income country). All the studies had various limitations and were classified as having a high risk of bias. Study findings suggest that the use of digital information systems to improve information and stock visibility, coupled with other interventions (such as training of health-care workers on the use of innovative tools and redesign of the supply chain to tackle certain bottlenecks), has the potential to increase vaccine availability, reduce response times, and improve the quality of vaccine records."

We develop a stylized model where a manufacturer distributes products through two separate retailers in two market segments, e.g., online vs. offline. The aim of this study is to investigate the impacts of competing retailers’ omnichannel moves on supply chain performance. Our model combines pricing interactions and channel move strategies from a supply-side perspective. We obtain three main results. First, though it is suitable for the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to adopt an omnichannel strategy, it may not be always good for the e-tailer. Second, omnichannel retail does not always lead to lower retail prices and enhanced consumer welfare. It may result in a lower price for the offline segment, but for the online segment, a higher price will be charged. Finally, omnichannel retail may not be good for the manufacturer. An equilibrium {Omnichannel, Digital channel only} strategy outcome of the retailers’ channel move game results in a higher demand and more profits for the manufacturer. However, the manufacturer is indeed hurt by the {Omnichannel, Omnichannel} equilibrium. Our study provides useful managerial insights into retailers’ omnichannel moves in a supply chain."

These marketplaces connect buyers and sellers and the marketplace owners act as central trustworthy authority to provide trade assurances. However, such a trust model could be problematic. Without any alternatives, rapidly growing users of the marketplace, both buyers and sellers are forced to trust the marketplace owner to satisfy their needs. Regulating users, control over digital transactions, exercising autonomy are other issues to name (but) a few indicating that marketplace owners are transparently replacing governments. In our view, Digital Marketplaces should be democratic as the markets in the real-world and control must be given back to the users since they are the contributors in the growth of these marketplaces. This paper presents a new way of Open Digital Marketplaces that model real-world buyer and seller interactions. Proposed solution involves users of marketplace as partakers in a digital transaction for connecting buyers and seller with trade assurances by leveraging their personal connections. Trust is made localized and the supply chain becomes subjective to the user as in the real-world. Switching the role of marketplace owner with the users, eliminates the need for trusting the marketplace owner as a central authority as well as diminishes autonomy and authority of the marketplace owner over the digital transactions. Users, with whose efforts trade is made digitally successful, are rewarded with an incentive, a type of shareholding in the digital transaction, as per the electronic contracts digitally signed by participants before executing the transaction. Disputes or violations of contract are resolved by an automated system, can also be escalated to an independent body or to a local court for a decision. Feedback received from the experiment based on the implementation of the proposed solution suggested ease of doing business by small businesses as well as increase in revenue. It also creates new opportunities for users to earn revenue share in digital transactions, instead of only the marketplace owners, in the emerging gig economy."

We address these issues by drawing on the experience of Encana Oil & Gas (USA) Inc. High fixed costs and declining gas prices required Encana to synchronize production with volatile demand for natural gas. To gain supply chain visibility, Encana's CIO and business leaders jointly targeted operational processes to embed digital technologies to capture, integrate and deliver information, established new Information Systems (IS) governance policies and redesigned the IS organizational structure.

This paper proposes a conceptual framework for a configurator unified through a manufacturing kit-of-parts. Kit-of-parts are pre-engineered and pre-designed digital models representing fabrication-ready components. Using production rules and restraints, accurate planning and design representations can be derived and utilized in the configurator. This research develops a configurator prototype using three-tier architecture. The prototype supports a low-to-high level of detail of kit-of-parts. It integrates product platforms and project development across multiple building phases including site planning, floor plan layout, and 3D model generation.

This process is projected to lead to a completely new level of process automation, thereby redefining the role of humans and altering current work designs in yet unknown ways. However, existing literature is rather ambiguous and not explicit on how the transformation towards CPS affects work design. In this study, we therefore consider this transformation at a much more detailed level. Our main contribution is the development of a framework to assess work design changes in the transformation towards CPS, and the consideration of the role of management choice therein. The framework relates (future) capabilities of CPS on the machine, production line, factory and supply chain scope to functions of human information processing. We then evaluate how the potential automation or augmentation of those functions by CPS affects job characteristics. Automation in this context is defined as the transfer of control and decision-making from humans to CPS, while augmentation means that technology is used to enhance human productivity or capability. We expect that the transformation towards CPS and the resulting automation and augmentation of tasks will shift the majority of human work to jobs characterized by high levels of job complexity, job autonomy and skill variety. This effect will become more severe when tasks are increasingly automated in the transformation towards CPS. During this development, human skills and knowledge will presumably remain critical in near future industrial production. Nevertheless, the ultimate implications for work design are strongly dependent on management choice. Strategic decisions are required on (1) which functions to automate across different scopes of operations and (2) how to group the resulting pool of tasks into jobs. This may result in various work designs. However, this choice is to a certain degree limited, and the role of technology is to restrict, rather than determine management choice."

FURTHER READING SMEs tend to be the first to feel the effects of financial crises. But their current plight is exacerbated by punitive payment terms that large companies began introducing in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown. These practices, in combination with the pandemic crisis, have starved countless SME suppliers of working capital and threaten to trigger a tidal wave of failures. There are ways to avoid this outcome. Governments should provide financial support geared to the needs of SMEs, and large companies can assist by identifying and supporting suppliers at risk. SMEs can help themselves through a more rigorous approach to managing their working capital. And innovative supply-chain-finance solutions, including a new generation of digital solutions, can play a key role in providing sources of credit for SMEs. These solutions must be applied as soon as possible.

However, previous research paid rare attention to how to provide trade promotions in a sustainable manner when consumer demand is disrupted. Considering that demand disruption is becoming surging because of the digital economy, it is quite necessary to discern the managerial implications for sustainable trade promotion practice in demand disruption scenarios. For this purpose, we analyze trade promotions under demand disruption by integrating demand uncertainty and limited capacity into a stylized demand disruption model. Three trade promotion types, i.e. off-invoice, scan-back, and revenue-sharing, are examined, and optimal promotion decisions are derived for each strategy. Our results show that both manufacturer and retailer would adopt aggressive pricing strategies as the demand disruption being intensified. For trade promotion strategies, our results show that, for a certain level of demand disruption, the manufacturer prefers off-invoice rather than revenue-sharing when the manufacturer needs to offer a more aggressive trade promotion. This result indicates that, when aggressive trade promotions are needed, the manufacturer may be worse off by a revenue-sharing strategy, even though the revenue-sharing could coordinate a supply chain."

In particular, it focuses on the innovations induced by ICT in farms and in new rural firms, and on how digital infrastructures support and generate social innovation mechanisms, leading to the consolidation of entrepreneurship and dissemination of ICT-based innovation in rural areas. The hypothesis is that the presence of digital infrastructures generates a double effect: overcoming the concept of geographical proximity (relevant for remote rural areas) and promoting social innovation. In particular, this paper examines the role of social innovation to create a new demand for products, services and organisational models for farms and rural enterprises, promoting further innovation. To target the objectives, the work analyses three case studies of new business models (BMs) based on ICT innovation. The analysis focuses on the most important interactions, learning and organisational processes within the new enterprises and among the new farms/enterprises and the other economic and institutional actors, and on how they were shaped and changed by the use of ICT, relating them to a conceptual model. These three cases, although pioneering, are important since they give an original response to some of the main problems and needs of remote and inner rural areas, as for the access to high value segment of food market, the information deliveries about attractiveness of landscape and countryside for foreigners, investors and tourists and the creation of new stable relation with consumers/citizens in the urban areas. The three cases have been analysed with the aim to identify how the ICT, and the related innovations, create an interconnection between four characteristic elements of the BMs (value creation, supply chain, customer interfaces, financial model) and the restructuring of proximity dimensions (cognitive, institutional, social, geographical, organizational). The work shows how these three cases have several communalities, but also different aspects with respect to our objective of analysis: there are different ways in which the four characteristic elements of the BM are constructed and also different in the role that the different dimensions of proximity play in structuring the innovation process in each one of them. More generally, the results of the work also lead to consider a new role for public investments in ICT infrastructures: public administrations should intervene in order to create a coherence within projects of public and private initiatives."

Providing either too much or too little customization can negatively impact both the business and the customer. This study introduces a decision-making method for product customization. This method takes into account the level of customization, production costs, and the product delivery time and applies the concept of postponement strategy to the product supply chain to boost overall supply chain effectiveness and customer satisfaction.

Multi-echelon, highly disjointed, and geographically spread are some of the cornerstones of today's supply chain. All these together with different governmental policies and human behavior make it almost impossible to probe incidents and trace events in case of supply chain disruptions. In effect, an end-to-end supply chain, from the most basic raw material to the final product in a customer's possession, is opaque. The inherent cost involved in managing supply chain intermediaries, their reliability, traceability, and transparency further complicate the supply chain. The solution to such complicated problems lies in improving supply chain transparency. This is now possible with the concept of blockchain. The usage of blockchain in a financial transaction is well known. This paper reviews blockchain technology, which is changing the face of supply chain and bringing in transparency and authenticity. This paper first discusses the history and evolution of blockchain from the bitcoin network, and goes on to explore the protocols. The author takes a deep dive into the design of blockchain, exploring its five pillars and three-layered architecture, which enables most of the blockchains today. With the architecture, the author focuses on the applications, use cases, road map, and challenges for blockchain in the supply chain domain as well as the synergy of blockchain with enterprise applications. It analyzes the integration of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of the supply chain domain with blockchain. It also explores the three distinct growth areas: ERP-blockchain supply chain use cases, the middleware for connecting the blockchain with ERP, and blockchain as a service (BaaS). The paper ends with a brief conclusion and a discussion."

The camera came with the virus straight out of the box. It hadn't been tampered with en route from the store. It turns out that malware and other threats are being inserted in the supply chain, and that this is not an isolated occurrence. Inserting malware in the supply chain is an excellent way to spread it around. After all, distribution is guaranteed if malware is bundled directly into a product. It will reach the computers of a very high percentage of purchasing customers, giving the malware vendor the chance to overcome any defences. In addition to the deliberate or accidental compromise of legitimate systems, customers must also cope with the danger of counterfeit systems that can show up both at the consumer and the enterprise level.

From the available references, both universal platforms and self-developed platforms are utilized for food printing. These platforms could be reconstructed in terms of process reformulation, material processing, and user interface in the near future. Three types of printing materials (i.e., natively printable materials, non-printable traditional food materials, and alternative ingredients) and two types of recipes (i.e., element-based recipe and traditional recipe) have been used for customized food fabrication. The available 3D food printing technologies and food processing technologies potentially applicable to food printing are presented.

As labor costs are high, several industries have suffered severely under the relocation of production facilities towards aspiring countries, which have managed to close the productivity and quality gap substantially. Established manufacturing companies have recognized that customers are not willing to pay large price premiums for incremental quality improvements. As a consequence, many companies from the German manufacturing industry adjust their production focusing on customized products and fast time to market. Leveraging the advantages of novel production strategies such as Agile Manufacturing and Mass Customization, manufacturing companies transform into integrated networks, in which companies unite their core competencies. Hereby, virtualization of the process-and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating entities. Boundaries of companies deteriorate, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. By including Cyber-Physical-Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-topics into the respective research field. To assess the practical implications, we conducted face-to-face interviews with managers from the industry as well as from the consulting business using a structured interview guideline. The results reveal reasons for the adaption and refusal of Industry 4.0 practices from a managerial point of view. Our findings contribute to the upcoming research stream of Industry 4.0 and support decision-makers to assess their need for transformation towards Industry 4.0 practices."

Even though recent research has proposed various methods and performed an increasing number of case studies, there are still issues of communication processes to be addressed. This paper presents a theoretical framework for digital systems integration of virtual models and smart technologies. Based on the comprehensive analysis of existing technologies for indoor localization, a new workflow is defined and designed, and it is utilized in a practical case study to test the model performance. In the new workflow, a facility management supporting platform is proposed and characterized, featuring indoor positioning systems to allow end users to send geo-referenced reports to central virtual models. In addition, system requirements, information technology (IT) architecture and application procedures are presented. Results show that the integration of end users in the maintenance processes through smart and easy tools can overcome the existing limits of barcode systems and building management systems for failure localization. The proposed framework offers several advantages. First, it allows the identification of every element of an asset including wide physical building elements (walls, floors, etc.) without requiring a prior mapping. Second, the entire cycle of maintenance activities is managed through a unique integrated system including the territorial dimension. Third, data are collected in a standard structure for future uses. Furthermore, the integration of the process in a centralized BIM-GIS (geographical information system) information management system admit a scalable representation of the information supporting facility management processes in terms of assets and supply chain management and monitoring from a spatial perspective."

Poor access and mortality due to non-availability of medicines is among the highest in the world. Access to essential medicines remains limited and inequitable. In a move towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the National Health Assurance Mission (NHAM) has been announced by the Central government for providing assurance to make 50 priority essential medicines available at all times at all levels to the citizens of India living below poverty line. This paper reviews, assesses and compares the strategies adopted by various Indian States for improving availability and access to medicines. The strengths and weaknesses of the two most challenging functions i.e., procurement and supply chain management are discussed in the paper. Centralized procurement of carefully selected priority essential medicines along with Supply Chain Management (SCM) by an outsourced agency appears promising under given constraints. Alternatively, SCM can be continued to be managed by states themselves but with adequate utilization of digital technology. Access to essential medicines as part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health (""the right to health"") is not only a social right but is also well-founded in country's constitution and health policy. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the government to ensure that this initiative is taken forward. Limited resources should not hold back this very important social commitment. Providing medicines to all, being an essential component of health care, should be implemented immediately to reduce out- of- pocket expenses for medicines"

Abstract Best practice exemplars suggest that digital platforms play a critical role in managing supply chain activities and partner ships that generate performance gains for firms. However, there is limited academic investigation on how and why information technology can create performance gains for firms in a supply chain management (SCM) context. Grant's (1996) theoretical notion of higher-order capabilities and a hierarchy of capabilities has been used in recent information systems research by Barua et al. (2004), Sambamurthy et al. (2003), and Mithas et al. (2004) to reframe the conversation from the direct performance impacts of IT resources and investments to how and why IT shapes higher-order process capabilities that create performance gains for firms. We draw on the emerging IT-enabled organizational capabilities perspective to suggest that firms that develop IT infra structure integration for SCM and leverage it to create a higher-order supply chain integration capability generate significant and sustainable performance gains. A research model is developed to investigate the hierarchy oflT-related capabilities and their impact on firm performance. Data were collected from 110 supply chain and logistics managers in manufacturing and retail organizations. Our results sug gest that integrated IT infrastructures enable firms to develop the higher-order capability of supply chain process integra tion. This capability enables firms to unbundle information flows from physical flows, and to share information with their supply chain partners to create information-based ap proaches for superior demand planning, for the staging and movement of physical products, and for streamlining volumi nous and complex financial work processes. Furthermore, IT-enabled supply chain integration capability results in significant and sustained firm performance gains, especially in operational excellence and revenue growth."

This pilot study illustrates how three separate business practices (i. e., process integration, supply chain management, and quality management) may relate to - and indeed reinforce - each other in this industry. Furthermore, this network-wide initiative can enhance new product development activities by integrating customer relationships management with collaborative design.

Meanwhile, paper-based documents of the site processes are ineffective and cannot get the quick response from the office and project control center. Integrating promising information technologies such as personal digital assistants (PDA), bar code scanning, and data entry mechanisms, can be extremely useful in improving the effectiveness and convenience of information flow in construction supply chain control systems. Bar code scanning is appropriate for several construction applications, providing cost savings through increased speed and accuracy of data entry.

Abstract Purpose: Decision support systems have become an indispensable tool for managing complex supply chains. This paper develops a multi-agent based supply chain management system that incorporates big data analytics that can exert autonomous corrective control actions. The effects of the system on supply chain agility are explored. Design/methodology/approach: For the development of the architecture of the system, a sequential approach is adopted. First three fundamental dimensions of supply chain agility are identified – responsiveness, flexibility and speed. Then the organisational design of the system is developed. The roles for each of the agents within the framework are defined and the interactions among these agents are modelled. Findings: Applications of the model are discussed, to show how the proposed model can potentially provide enhanced levels in each of the dimensions of supply chain agility. Research limitations/implications: The study shows how the multi-agent systems can assist to overcome the trade-off between supply chain agility and complexity of global supply chains. It also opens up a new research agenda for incorporation of big data and semantic web applications for the design of supply chain information systems. Practical implications: The proposed information system provides integrated capabilities for production, supply chain event and disruption risk management under a collaborative basis Originality/value. A novel aspect in the design of multi-agent systems is introduced for inter-organisational processes, which incorporates semantic web information and a big data ontology in the agent society."

These days, any organization can leverage technology to create new customer delight benchmarks that influence the financial services paradigm and bank customers’ expectations. The World Retail Banking Report (WRBR) 2019 from Capgemini and Efma examines the successful customer experience approaches of various innovators and breaks down the challenges faced by retail banks when it comes to customer experience. Our observation is that banks have the right products, but they are lagging behind and giving ground to non-traditional players in the last-mile customer experience. As popularized in supply chain management and logistics, last mile is what individuals experience and remember. In banking, a positive last-mile experience is the result of personalized product packaging and seamless interactions – connections between processes, internal departments, partners, channels, and product delivery. Friction in banking interactions and less-than-robust omnichannel solutions drag user satisfaction metrics down, according to Capgemini’s Voice of the Customer 2019 survey of more than 8,000 consumers across 20 countries. Meanwhile, BigTechs and challenger banks are capturing the last mile of the banking value chain by swapping the conventional rulebook for offerings designed around customer needs. Now,"

The hypothesis of the article is as follow digital technologies driving exponential growth translate into companies’ efforts to be both lean and agile. The problem raised in the study is of being both lean and agile facing the digital disruption. The topic of the impact of digital technologies on value chains has gained an increasing attention from business practitioners. Scholars also have heavily discussed capabilities required for adaptation to technologies driving nonlinear growth. The applied methods encompasses the literature review combined with diagnostic participant action research. The understanding of lean and agile practices was a starting point to build a tool for covering impact of digital technologies on value chains. The literature review allows us to explain reasons for the fast progress in digitalization, defining the digital technologies driving the exponential growth, providing explanation of what is lean, agile and leagile supply chain. Building on the literature review the diagnostic participant action research was applied. The latter allows to verify the assumed hypothesis. While technology and the digital world grow exponentially, the manner in which we operate and organize ourselves is still based on linear models, hierarchical structures and bureaucratic processes. For a reason of this, the deployment of the lean and agile practices would be of benefit to build customer centric solutions. The article provides contribution to models of adaptation of multinationals supply chains towards digital technologies. Whilst the practical study proved that absorption of digital technology is in its infancy, the built diagnostic tool allows us to map the absorption of digital technologies with regards to logistics needs of customers. The conducted study proved existing more than two practices defined by covering logistics customers’ requirements. As a recommendation for the further work would be covering transformation from linear to exponential organization."

Blockchain enables the tracking and recording of the history of each transaction in a ledger stored in the cloud that cannot be altered, and when blockchain is combined with digital signatures, it verifies the identity of the participants with its non-repudiation capabilities. One of the weaknesses of blockchain is the difficulty of preventing malicious participants from gaining access to public–private key pairs. Groups of opponents often interact freely with the network, and this is a security concern when cloud-based methods manage the key pairs. Therefore, we are proposing end-to-end security schemes by both inserting tamper-resistant devices in the hardware of the peripheral devices and using ternary cryptography. The tamper-resistant devices, which are designed with nanomaterials, act as Physical Unclonable Functions to generate secret cryptographic keys. One-time use public–private key pairs are generated for each transaction. In addition, the cryptographic scheme incorporates a third logic state to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks. The generation of these public–private key pairs is compatible with post quantum cryptography. The third scheme we are proposing is the use of noise injection techniques used with high-performance computing to increase the security of the system. We present prototypes to demonstrate the feasibility of these schemes and to quantify the relevant parameters. We conclude by presenting the value of blockchains to secure the logistics of additive manufacturing operations."

To keep their services competitive, infrastructure managers (such as port authorities) seek new approaches in managing and delivering information to their users. Starting from existing technological advancements and exploring the declared opportunities enabled by (near) future ones, a range of solutions (e.g. real-time information platforms, dynamic information boards or digital on-request notification solutions) can be pursued. This research investigates how an advanced truck guidance system (TGS) leverages on technology and leads to more efficient resource (infrastructure, equipment and labour) usage. The current paper merges two perspectives. The first conducts interviews with representatives of different logistics stakeholders to highlight their data needs. The second perspective is given by a review of information communication technology (ICT) innovative trends. These two perspectives provide an up-to-date overview of both needs (demand) and opportunities (supply) that challenge logistics stakeholders. This study proposes a TGS architecture that merges the two perspectives and identifies a stepwise approach to implement it. Therefore, the roles, costs and benefits brought to the logistics stakeholders are highlighted for each step. The key findings of this study show that road transport operators would benefit from operational savings and increased performance, while the other supply chain stakeholders can benefit from setting up a more reliable planning, better managing their infrastructure and developing added-value services for clients. To enable these benefits, the port administration could take the facilitator role and cover the TGS’s development costs."

Realizing the strength of blockchain technology beyond the successful application in the cryptocurrency arena, researchers have been evaluating and using blockchain for applications such as supply chain management, transactive industry (both financial and energy), system integrity, device cybersecurity, identity management, and much more. One of the unique elements of the blockchain technology that made it such a captivating technology to researchers is its plethora of features. Some of the features include smart contracts, cryptocurrency and tokenizing, immutable distributed ledger, cryptographic hashing, and digital signature. In addition, there are multiple types of blockchains, such as permissioned/private and permissionless/ public, and various consensus models, such as proof-of-work, proof-of-authority, proof-of-burn, and proof-of-stake. Therefore, it is often nontrivial to determine if an application requires a blockchain. If so, what kind of blockchain and consensus is most appropriate? This article discusses the blockchain applicability framework (BAF), whichwas specifically designed with the purpose to answer those questions. The BAF is divided into five domains, 18 subdomains, and about 100 controls. It is designed to ingest detailed user requirements to perform a weighted evaluation that is built on mathematical constructs to determine the ideal combination of blockchain that is appropriate for an application. Along with the core logical formulation of the BAF, this article depicts the efficacy of the BAF through two use cases.

But this reset moment (which is also technology-driven – by virtue of the mass adoption of smart mobile) has forced retailers to service consumers’ new digitally enabled anytime/anywhere shopping behaviors. That in turn is causing retailers to think about how to move beyond a pure “push” oriented supply chain that assumes the store as the only destination for inventory. Key findings • Retailers understand that omni-channel customer behaviors are bringing new pressures on supply chain, but they have not fully connected the dots between their business challenges, like the changing pattern of consumer demand, and how their digital strategies impact these supply chain-driven challenges, for example, as digital channel growth remains a high priority. • Retailers are reaching for the brass ring when it comes to their opportunities: targeting fulfillment from the most profitable location as their primary omni-channel fulfillment opportunity. However, without increased visibility across their network, their ability to achieve this goal is doubtful. • While retailers acknowledge that major changes need to come to supply chain, they are not necessarily best-positioned to invent a new supply chain model, particularly when it comes to cross-functional involvement. For many retailers, there may be too much marketing involvement and not enough from the CFO. • The largest retailers are looking to big technology investments to assist their supply chain transformations, but their smaller counterparts are under-estimating what technology - particularly in a cloud-enabled, third-party environment - can do for them."

It investigates the technology, innovation and systemic changes required to enable circular supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: The research study uses a qualitative, interpretivist approach, drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Scandinavian fashion industry. Findings: The main inhibitors to textile-to-textile recycling systems in the Scandinavian fashion industry are: limited technology which creates a challenge for separating materials; high costs of research and development and building the supporting logistics; complexity of supply chains including the multitude of stakeholders involved in product development. The enablers are design and use of new materials, increased garment collection and collaboration. This research suggests that sorting and recycling technology can be enhanced with the use of digital technologies, as this would create transparency, traceability and automatisation. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by a small sample size and lack of representation of all key stakeholder groups, which limits the ability to generalise these findings. However, as an exploratory study, the findings provide insights that can be further tested in other contexts. Originality/value: Understanding of textile-to-textile recycling is emerging both theoretically and practically, however, there is still much that is not understood. This research contributes to furthering understanding of how technology, collaboration and systemic change in the fashion industry can support opportunities for textile-to-textile recycling, thereby aligning with circular economy principles."

Since production processes and systems can be more intelligent, they allow to reach the high-quality standards required in service, what is the only way to maximize the improvement of its components from the very beginning of the process.Digitalization is one of the main levers to enhance business and increase competitiveness in the industry, that provides huge opportunities in the future. One of the important conditions is increase flexibility, that allows quickly to adapt production facilities and processes to changes in production and product lines of customer. The digitalization strategy should be applied transversely to all processes, starting from production, logistics, and quality till design, procurement, human resources, or finance. Transversal applying of digitalization strategy is possible in the creation of technology centers graphic engineering worldwide, the use of computerized simulation, CAD systems and virtual 3D environments for research, analysis, evaluation, validation and improvement of production processes. The important aspect to form the future is the development of innovative solutions that contribute turning new concepts into an industrial reality.The revolution in logistics digitalization gives automakers and service providers the opportunity to stay flexible and to be ahead of time. The main transformers are data and digital rethinking of the supply chain, that contribute a significant growth in trade. Advanced automakers create a digital workforce and program robots to solve repetitive tasks. All this provides full flexibility in software development with integrated in it robot’s hardware, fast iterations and adjustments, when it is necessary, which might not have been easily achieved using traditional methods. These projects can be extended to ones with greater investment. Mainly, more flexible and service-oriented solutions can be implemented as a response to speed and automation in logistics. Thereby, it is possible to satisfy the changing and demanding needs of customers now and in the future."

The aim of this study is to fill this research gap by exploring the issues of Industry 4.0 in the service sector, with cases in the hospitality industry. All the challenges of Industry 4.0 require continuous innovation and learning, which is dependent on people and the enterprise’s capabilities. Appropriate management approaches can play a vital role in the development of dynamic capabilities, and an effective learning and innovation environment. This paper proposes a framework of management practices which can promote the environment of innovation and learning in an organization, and hence facilitate business to match the pace of Industry 4.0 by facilitating technology acceptance e.g., digital enhancements and implementation of cyber physical systems (CPS). This study integrates the literature with logical beliefs to suggest the appropriate management practices for Industry 4.0. It represents one of the initial attempts to draw research attention towards the important role of management practices in Industry 4.0, as most of the recent studies have been restricted to the technological aspects. Semi-structured interviews of hospitality employees are conducted to explore the management practices suitable for meeting the challenges of Industry 4.0, specifically for informing the service sector."

Executives must pay attention to how their companies create value in both arenas--the marketplace and the marketspace. But the processes for accomplishing this are not the same in the two worlds. Managers who understand how to master both can create and extract value in the most efficient and effective manner. The stages involved in creating value in the physical world are often referred to as links in a value chain. The value chain is a model that describes a series of value-adding activities connecting a company's supply side with its demand side. By analyzing the stages of a value chain, managers have been able to redesign their internal and external processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness. However, the value chain model treats information as a supporting element of the value-adding process, not as a source of value itself. To create value with information, managers must look to the marketspace. The value-adding processes that companies must employ to turn raw information into new marketspace services and products are unique to the information world. In other words, the value-adding steps are virtual in that they are performed through and with information. Creating value in any stage of a virtual value chain involves a sequence of five activities: gathering, organizing, selecting, synthesizing, and distributing information. Just as someone takes raw material and refines it into something useful, so a manager today collects raw information and adds value through these five steps.

It also gives the prospect on how the sector should approach the “new normal” which will follow the current health emergency and be resilient in case of future outbreaks. The paper identifies several impacts that are already taking place in different instances such as the global consumers’ behaviour. Due to the current lockdown situation interaction between producers and consumers has changed radically, and the supply chain had to adapt to cover necessities of citizens. The effects of the outbreak have been profound in consumption, however a growth in eCommerce and digital services have gained in importance and it is supposed to continue growing. The pandemic also had effects on the transport sector, to the point that a new paradigm of mobility will be necessary to meet environmental demands. The crisis halted passengers’ mobility and limited air and sea freight capacity significantly. On the contrary, long-distance trans-Eurasian rail lines have been untouched. The pandemic had positive impacts on the environment as well. However, the trend of low production of GHG emission is expected to reverse course once containment measures are lifted. Transport will have an important role in the predicted rebound effect of GHG emissions; thus, the development of green new mobility is essential.Analysing the forecast of the transport sector, railways will have distinct advantages over other transport modes both during the acute phase of the pandemic and the “new normal”. On the other hand, underuse of the rail sector can lead to a collapse of the urban transport system. Lastly, this paper introduces the concept of 5 “R” as the necessary steps the rail sector needs to undertake to play a significant role in tomorrow’s mobility. These steps are Resilience, Return, Reimagination, Reform, and Research. In particular, the paper highlights research needs which are considered essential in enhancing rail competitiveness. In conclusion, this paper reminds that this historic event must be considered as an opportunity to truly establish rail as the backbone of the European sustainable mobility."

Three different conditions of λ, µ are taken into consideration of complete evaluation of blocks acceptance and the mathematical tactic will open a sequence of possibly favorable research in queueing theory of blockchain systems.

That needs to change. The digital revolution is now breaching the walls of manufacturing as it continues to disrupt media, finance, consumer products, healthcare, and other sectors. Indeed, the explosion in data and new computing capabilities—along with advances in other areas such as artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, additive technology, and human-machine interaction—are unleashing innovations that will change the nature of manufacturing itself. Industry and academic leaders agree that digital-manufacturing technologies will transform every link in the manufacturing value chain, from research and development, supply chain, and factory operations to marketing, sales, and service. Digital connectivity among designers, managers, workers, consumers, and physical industrial assets will unlock enormous value and change the manufacturing landscape forever. Yet while manufacturing generates more data than any other sector of the economy, few companies are harnessing it. One oil-and-gas company, for example, discards 99 percent of its data before decision makers have a chance to use it. We believe that companies that can close this gap by tapping the data they generate (and what's publicly available) will uncover valuable insights to drive profits and growth. Consider traditional car manufacturers and Uber, which are both—at the highest level—in the business of moving people around. Car makers meet that need on the floors of factories and showrooms, using a century of manufacturing experience. Uber meets people's transportation needs not with steel, glass, rubber, and salespeople but with data, matching individual riders and vehicles via smart phones. Barely five years into its existence, it is valued at about $50 billion. Uber's data, algorithms, and enormous growth prospects have already made it more valuable than all of the physical assets, intellectual property, and brand names of some of the world's biggest car manufacturers. It comes as no surprise, then, that manufacturers are waking up to the opportunities and threats of digitization. In the United States, the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation is organizing six major research institutes to speed new manufacturing technologies to market. While all of these institutes have a digital component, one is focused specifically on digital manufacturing. 1 Similar efforts are underway across the globe, including Germany's Industry 4.0 effort and China's Made in China 2025. One global convening organization, the Industrial Internet Consortium, was founded just 18 months ago and already has 175 members."

Abstract Purpose – The aim is to contribute significantly to the first wave of empirical investigations related to the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on performance. The paper also aims to theorize and empirically assess a comprehensive GSCM practices and performance model. The model incorporates green supply chain practices that link manufacturers with supply chain partners (both suppliers and customers) to support environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Data collected from 159 manufacturing managers were analyzed using a structural equation modeling methodology. Manufacturing managers provide data reflecting the degree to which their organizations work with suppliers and customers to improve environmental sustainability of the supply chain. Findings – Generally, the adoption of GSCM practices by manufacturing organizations leads to improved environmental performance and economic performance, which, in turn, positively impact operational performance. Operational performance enhances organizational performance. Research limitations/implications – As a first wave empirical investigation of the impact of GSCM practices on performance, the study is by necessity exploratory. Practical implications – Practitioners are provided with a framework for assessing the synergistic impact of GSCM practices on performance. Internal environmental management and green information systems are identified as necessary precursors to the implementation of green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design, and investment recovery. Originality/value – A comprehensive GSCM practices performance model is proposed and empirically assessed. The results of this investigation support the proposition that GSCM practices are both environmentally necessary and good business. A structured two-wave approach to the implementation of GSCM practices is recommended."

The methodological basis relies on the provisions of the theory of logistic management including the issues of interfirm and interorganizational interaction that is formed under the influence of the evolutionary factor of logistic integration. The data of the expert survey and analysis of aggregated indicators of logistic intersystem entities functioning in the Russian Federation help to identify the most integrated intersystem logistic entities. The Digital Transformation Index developed by foreign researchers and adjusted to the Russian practice allows us to investigate the depth of logistic integration and the level of digitalization of interorganizational logistic entities. The authors establish that there is an interrelation between the stages of logistic integration evolution and the development of forms of intersystem (interorganizational) logistic entities. The paper proposes a method for evaluating the depth of logistic integration and provides the estimates of this indicator and reference values for the levels of management digitalization for intersystem logistic entities typical of the Russian reality. The research results are of use for business practitioners when choosing management tools for particular forms of interorganizational logistic systems, including the instruments based on digital technology, as well as for scholars studying management in general and logistics and supply chain management, in particular.

New and emerging digital technologies are an important driver of global change, offering both opportunities for, and threats to, business, welfare, and social-ecological sustainability, including rural enterprises and rural communities. Some of these technologies will have incremental influences on changing enterprises and supply chains, however, others may potentially be very disruptive to the current New Zealand agricultural system, rural enterprises and value chains, and rural lives. The purpose of this paper is to 1) contextualise factors influencing technology development and adoption, 2) survey new and emerging digital technologies and, 3) foresight some potential implications for agricultural enterprises and rural communities in the next 20 years. Precision agriculture, agricultural robotics, computerised farm management decision support, and the digitisation of agriculture are changing the nature, efficiency and transparency of agricultural production. However, the digital farming revolution is occurring in the context of a wide range of co-evolving technologies (many also digitally based), and social and political change, which open up new meaningful possibilities for living and working in rural and remote locations. At the same time, the requirements of consumers are changing to reflect a greater focus on sustainable agriculture, ethical food production and delivery, the social conditions of employees, and quality assurance, nutritional value, and provenance of food. There will be interplay between the evolving nature of rural lifestyles and rural enterprises wrought through technological development. Foresight endeavours, though fallible, may act as a springboard for rural residents to recognise and realise emerging opportunities and mitigate potential threats. Awareness of technological trajectories may help communities to strategically prepare for an increasingly digital future, enhancing their resilience and adaptability to inevitable change. Responsible technological development and responsible business practices will be key to engendering the increased trust and collaboration required amongst agricultural value chain participants in order to fully realise the potential benefits of digital agriculture."

The role of digital technologies for fostering sustainability and efficiency in forest-based supply chains is well acknowledged and motivated several studies in the scope of precision forestry. Sensor technologies can collect relevant data in forest-based supply chains, comprising all activities from within forests and the production of the woody raw material to its transformation into marketable forest-based products. Advanced planning systems can help to support decisions of the various entities in the supply chain, e.g., forest owners, harvest companies, haulage companies, and forest product processing industry. Such tools can help to deal with the complex interdependencies between different entities, often with opposing objectives and actions—which may increase efficiency of forest-based supply chains. This paper analyzes contemporary literature dealing with digital technologies in forest-based supply chains and summarizes the state-of-the-art digital technologies for real-time data collection on forests, product flows, and forest operations, as well as planning systems and other decision support systems in use by supply chain actors. Higher sustainability and efficiency of forest-based supply chains require a seamless information flow to foster integrated planning of the activities over the supply chain—thereby facilitating seamless data exchange between the supply chain entities and foster new forms of collaboration. Therefore, this paper deals with data exchange and multi-entity collaboration aspects in combination with interoperability challenges related with the integration among multiple process data collection tools and advanced planning systems. Finally, this interdisciplinary review leads to the discussion of relevant guidelines that can guide future research and integration projects in this domain."

We consider a firm which can sell an experience good in physical form, in digitized form, or both. We analyze different pricing schemes - price for whole album on the retail channel and linear and nonlinear pricing for songs on the digital channel. Consumers are divided into a retail-captive segment whose consumers are limited to the retail channel and a hybrid segment whose consumers have access to both retail and digital channels. Our findings indicate that for realistic problems, the dual distribution channel is most profitable. The profitability of the retail channel increases with the size of the retail-captive segment and the number of desirable songs on an album relative to the total number of songs on it. We show that a skimming pricing strategy is best for the retail channel. The ability to sell the product in digitized form on the Internet erodes much of the power once enjoyed by the record labels. The digital channel may be the best way to promote new artists, especially when the hybrid consumer segment is large. We also find that piracy has a significant effect on channel profits for both the retail and digital channels. Piracy has the strongest negative impact on the exclusive retail channel. Consumers' access to the digital channel reduces piracy in both digital and dual-channel distribution. Dual channel suffers least from piracy because it allows retail-captive consumers to still legally obtain the product. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

For this reason, the author considered as very interesting and relevant the exploration of online corporate communications strategies and the untapped opportunities for businesses in Romania, as a research direction of the present paper. When considering the use of social media (including big data) by organizations present in Romania, they must not only think about consumers or the marketing objectives strictly related to them, but rather to the overall processes of the company and about all the ways in which social media can help develop the new products, supply chain management or customer relationship management. The companies' access to a large volume of relatively inexpensive data about consumers' choices, preferences and buying behaviour, enables them to develop valuable skills and actually places them in a favoured position to succeed in developing the brand equity and influence consumers' purchasing behaviour through social media."

Design/methodology/approach A mixed interpretivist and post-positivist epistemological lens is adopted to pursue the proof-of-concept’s development. From an operational perspective, a synthesis of literature using interpretivism provides the foundation for deductive research inquiry implemented within a case study approach. Within the case study, participatory action research (PAR) is implemented to test the proof of concept via three “waterfall” research phases, namely, literature diagnosis and BIM package selection, BDO development and validation and evaluation. Findings The findings illustrate that a BDO (which represents the digital twin of manufacturing products) can augment and drive automation processes and workflows for construction product manufacturers within a contractor’s supply chain. The developed framework illustrates the benefits of a BDO, by reducing the number of manufacturing processes to effectively eliminate early errors in the model, generates financial savings and reduces material wastage. Originality/value This research provides a seminal case study that implements BDO to automate construction product manufacturing processes and demonstrates the utilisation of BDO at an operational (vis-à-vis theoretical) level. Future research is proposed to implement a longitudinal approach to measure and report upon the success (or otherwise) of the proof of concept when implemented on fabrications and shop floor procedures."

We argue that digitalization can do the same within the medical supply chain. Methods We utilise conceptual theory building. This is supported by a literature review and an interview conducted with a key actor within the Finnish pharmaceutical arena. Results 1) Electronic prescription has the potential to increase the information between physician and patient. Some positive results have been obtained relating to medication safety. 2) The generic substitution system has been implemented to decrease the information asymmetry relating to medicine prices. This has had an effect on the annual medicine expenditures in Finland. 3) These developments have however no influence to the lack of patient adherence. It is a form of information asymmetry with a grave impact to the healthcare system. Adherence could be alleviated with digital solutions. These include solutions supporting patient engagement as well as controlled delivery of medicines at home. 4) Outcomes-based medicine tries to decrease the uncertainty in the field of medical care. This can be alleviated with data gathered from the patient with innovations such as wearables. This can have impact also to the moral hazard threat in the health insurance field. 5) Overall, there is more information available on medical treatments, which should be utilised to increase the patient engagement. 6) Medicine spoilage and shortage are severe information asymmetry related problems. Digital systems could support the prediction of the demand and real time tracking of the consumption of medicines. Conclusions Digitalization could improve the medical supply chain by decreasing the information asymmetries between different actors.

The present case examined core FMEs along with retail micro-entrepreneurs (RMEs) deployed in low-resource rural and urban communities. Structural equation modeling was used to compare rural outcomes and the role of homegrown consumption as a mediator. Multivariable linear regression and ANOVA were used to test group differences in the urban sample. Positive β coefficients represent an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption in communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem in contrast to the comparison group. Farmers in rural communities exposed to the eKutir ecosystem consumed more overall fruit and vegetables (β = 0.30, p < 0.001) and fruits alone (β = 0.53, p < 0.05) than those farmers in comparison villages unexposed to the eKutir ecosystem. This effect was concentrated in households exposed to both FMEs + RMEs (β = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and was mediated by homegrown consumption. A non-significant directional effect was observed in comparing fruit and vegetable consumption in rural households exposed to RMEs only over comparison communities. Urban consumers, exposed to the eKutir ecosystem through access to RMEs operating in their neighborhood community, did not increase their fruit or vegetable consumption compared to non-intervention communities. The results reveal the potential of reaching nutritional impacts through homegrown consumption and with farm-level support outside of governmental/philanthropic interventions through an ICT-enabled social enterprise. They also underscore, however, the challenges of both changing eating behaviour and intervening along the agri-food value chain. Implication for more effective digital ecosystem design and intersectoral policies are discussed."

Efficient use of this information requires a concrete analytical model that can be easily represented in digital form. In this paper we present a modeling framework for process plans based on a branch of mathematics called category theory (CT). Specifically, string diagrams provide an intuitive yet precise graphical syntax for describing symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs), mathematical structures which support serial and parallel composition. Ideal for process representation, these structures also support a powerful mathematical toolkit. Here we use these tools to analyze the relationship between different levels of abstraction in process planning hierarchy. We also model some spatiotemporal aspects of planning, dynamic decision-making inside the process hierarchy and the updating procedure in the event of errors or extensions in the production line."

Here's a look at how they're doing this today-and how they might do so tomorrow. Consumer-goods companies have been at the forefront of digital innovation in commercial areas such as marketing and sales. Supply chain and operations have been less of a focus for their digital efforts, but recently, leading consumer-goods companies have started to explore the use of digital solutions in manufacturing processes. This is a natural development; Industry 4.0-the digitization of the entire manufacturing value chain-is slowly becoming a reality. 1 Some consumer-goods companies, however, are unsure where to start: Which aspects of manufacturing can benefit most from today's digital technologies? And what should leading-edge companies set their sights on next? In this article, we examine the two most prevalent ways in which consumer-goods companies are using digitization in manufacturing: applying digital tools to lean transformations and using advanced analytics to optimize specific manufacturing processes. We then look at the next horizon of opportunity for digital manufacturing in the consumer-goods sector. Finally, we discuss the organizational enablers that can help digital-manufacturing efforts succeed. Taking lean to a new level Lean transformations have already had a dramatic impact on many companies, but digital solutions are taking lean operations to a new level.

According to a new McKinsey Global Survey of executives, 1 their companies have accelerated the digitization of their customer and supply-chain interactions and of their internal operations by three to four years. And the share of digital or digitally enabled products in their portfolios has accelerated by a shocking seven years. 2 Nearly all respondents say that their companies have stood up at least temporary solutions to meet many of the new demands on them, and much more quickly than they had thought possible before the crisis. What's more, respondents expect most of these changes to be long lasting and are already making the kinds of investments that all but ensure they will stick. In fact, when we asked executives about the impact of the crisis on a range of measures, they say that funding for digital initiatives has increased more than anything else-more than increases in costs, the number of people in technology roles, and the number of customers. To stay competitive in this new business and economic environment requires new strategies and practices. 3 Our findings suggest that executives are taking note: most respondents recognize technology's strategic importance as a critical component of the business, not just a source of cost efficiencies. Respondents from the companies that have executed successful responses to the crisis report a range of technology capabilities that others don't-most notably, filling gaps for technology talent during the crisis, the use of more advanced technologies, and speed in experimenting and innovating. 4 Digital adoption has taken a quantum leap at both the organizational and industry levels During the pandemic, consumers have moved dramatically toward online channels, 5 and companies and industries have responded in turn. The survey results confirm the rapid shift toward interacting with customers through digital channels. They also show that rates of adoption are years ahead of where they were when previous surveys were conducted-and even more in developed Asia than in other regions (Exhibit 1). Respondents are three times likelier now than before the crisis to say that at least 80 percent of their customer interactions are digital in nature. Perhaps more surprising is the speedup in creating digital or digitally enhanced offerings. Across regions, the results suggest a seven-year increase, on average, in the rate at which companies are developing these products and services. Once again, the leap is even greater-ten years-in developed Asia (Exhibit 2). Respondents also report a similar mix of types of digital products in their portfolios before and during the pandemic. This finding suggests that during the crisis, companies have probably refocused their offerings rather than made huge leaps in product development in the span of a few months. Across sectors, the results suggest that rates for developing digital products during the pandemic differ. Given the time frames for making manufacturing changes, the differences, not surprisingly, are more apparent between sectors with and without physical products than between B2B and B2C companies. Respondents in consumer 1 The online survey was in the field from July 7 to July 31, 2020, and garnered responses from 899 C-level executives and senior managers representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, and functional specialties. 2 We looked at the past results for the degree of digital adoption reported in each of these areas of business operations. Based on the average percentage of adoption in each survey, we calculated a trendline to represent the average rate of adoption in 2017, 2018, and just before the crisis, which respondents were asked about in the 2020 survey. The acceleration time frame was calculated from the amount of time it would have taken to reach the current level of digital adoption respondents report if the precrisis pace of change had continued."

Stakeholders in maritime transport continue to exchange physical documents in order to conduct business. The monitoring of supply chain goods, communication among employees, environmental sustainability and longevity control, along with time framing, all create challenges to many industries. Everyday onboard work, such as cargo operations, navigation and various types of inspections in shipping, still requires paper documents and logs that need to be signed (and stamped). The conversion of traditional paper contracts into smart contracts, which can be digitalized and read through automation, provides a new wave of collaboration between eco systems across the shipping industry. Various data collected and stored on board ships could be used for scientific purposes. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be used to collect all those data and improve shipping operations by process expediting. It could eliminate the need to fill in various documents and logs and make operations safer and more environmentally friendly. Information about various important procedures onboard ships could be shared among all interested stakeholders. This paper considers the possible application of distributed ledger technology as an aid for the control of overboard discharge of wastewater from commercial ships. The intended outcome is that it could help protect the environment by sending data to relevant stakeholders in real time, thus providing information regarding the best discharge areas. The use of a structured communal data transference would ensure a consistent and accurate way to transmit data to all interested parties, and would eliminate the need to fill in various paper forms and logs. Wastewater overboard discharges would be properly monitored, recorded and measured, as distributed ledger technology would prevent any possibility of illegal actions and falsification of documents, thus ensuring environmental sustainability."

The main reason is due to the digital transformation that is occurring in business, changing all processes and, as a consequence, consumer behavior. This new retail model, much more interactive and integrated, is taking over the market. Retail distribution systems are considered multi- or omni- channel systems when consumers can place orders to buy products: online, physically and online in the stores. Nowadays, most companies try to increase their sales using this recent business model called omni-channel retailing. This is changing the way companies sell their products. These changes can be seen both in the internal logistics of retailers and in the structure and processes of the supply chain. It integrates two existing distribution systems: the retail distribution system and the consumer distribution system. The current study aims to understand this model that integrates the digital and offline and raise its key implications for the strategies applied in logistics."

The proper spelling is as two words, which we therefore prefer. Rock glaciers are landforms that form as a result of creeping mountain permafrost which have received considerable attention concerning their dynamical and thermal changes. Observed changes in rock glacier motion on seasonal to decadal timescales have been linked to ground temperature variations and related changes in landform geometries interpreted as signs of degradation due to climate warming. Despite the extensive kinematic and thermal monitoring of these creeping permafrost landforms, our understanding of the controlling factors remains limited and lacks robust quantitative models of rock glacier evolution in relation to their environmental setting. Here, we use a holistic approach to analyze the current and long-term dynamical development of two rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps. Site-specific sedimentation and ice generation rates are linked with an adapted numerical flow model for rock glaciers that couples the process chain from material deposition to rock glacier flow in order to reproduce observed rock glacier geometries and their general dynamics. Modeling experiments exploring the impact of variations in rock glacier temperature and sediment-ice supply show that these forcing processes are not sufficient to explain the currently observed short-term geometrical changes derived from multitemporal digital terrain models at the two different rock glaciers. The modeling also shows that rock glacier thickness is dominantly controlled by slope and rheology while the advance rates are mostly constrained by rates of sedimentice supply. Furthermore, timescales of dynamical adjustment are found to be strongly linked to creep velocity. Overall, we provide a useful modeling framework for a better understanding of the dynamical response and morphological changes of rock glaciers to changes in external forcing."

The used analysing methods were making calculations, pivot tables, models, dasboards. We found that a significant portion of businesses, 78 %, use mobile devices in the manufacturing process. The three most relevant digital technologies are geolocating (GPS, GNSS), cloud computing, and sensor technology. The current level of digitalization and integration cannot be said to be high, but respondents are very optimistic about expectations. Improvements are expected in all areas in the next 2-3 years in terms of digitalisation and integration.

To achieve efficient power delivery over moderate distance, WPT usually relies on highly directional power transmission from the energy transmitter (ET) to the energy receiver (ER). To this end, the ET needs to be equipped with a large number of antennas and employ adaptive energy beamforming to flexibly control the energy focusing directions to the ER based on the multipath channels between them. However, this renders the conventional fully digital beamforming with one dedicated RF chain for each transmit antenna too costly, in terms of both hardware implementation and energy consumption. To overcome this issue, we study in this paper, a new WPT system based on the hybrid analog or digital beamforming technique, where the number of RF chains is in general significantly less than that of transmit antennas. We first show that for a general point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output WPT system over frequency-selective channels, hybrid beamforming is able to achieve the optimal performance as the fully digital beamforming, as long as the number of RF chains at the ET is no less than twice the number of sub-bands used or twice the number of channel paths. Furthermore, for the special cases of line-of-sight channel or multiple-input single-output WPT, the required number of RF chains can be further reduced to equal the number of channel paths only. Finally, for the scenarios when the given number of RF chains is insufficient to achieve the fully digital beamforming performance, we propose efficient algorithms for the hybrid beamforming design to maximize its efficiency. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid beamforming design."

Against the backdrop of almost non-existent logistic and supply chain infrastructure, weak regulatory framework, low penetration of smartphones and Internet, low consumer confidence and trust on online transactions, digital entrepreneurs in developing countries literally have to build the platform ecosystem along with their organization. In this paper, we use institutional theory as a lens to trace the emergence and evolution of digital platforms in India.  We posit that digital platforms are emerging organizational fields embodying new network logics with algorithms and technology-mediated interactions playing a central role in creating value. In particular, we take the case of Ola, an online cab aggregator from India to illustrate that digital platforms as organizational field evolve through three phases of (a) innovation introduction, (b) mobilization and (c) structuration. In the first phase, the organizational field characteristics are consequences of activities undertaken to raise cognitive legitimacy and respond to competitive forces. In the second phase, a mix of coercive and mimetic forces shape the institutional field resulting in increase in socio-political legitimacies. In the third phase, the process of structuration sets in as isomorphic forces become more normative. The theoretical framework developed in this paper contributes to extant information system research by putting forth that the characteristics of emerging organizational field are shaped by the interplay between the responses of the focal organization to isomorphic forces, and the actions taken by it to establish cognitive and socio-political legitimacies. Empirically the study is on digital platforms located in a large developing country with very high potential for online transactions but relatively low penetration of Internet and smartphones. Conceptualizing organizational field as digital platforms enables making sense of the changing business landscape, and examine issues of sustainability and legitimacy."

Centralized procurement of carefully selected priority essential medicines along with Supply Chain Management (SCM) by an outsourced agency appears promising under given constraints. Alternatively, SCM can be continued to be managed by states themselves but with adequate utilization of digital technology. Access to essential medicines as part of the right to the highest attainable standard of health (""the right to health"") is not only a social right but is also well-founded in country's constitution and health policy. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the government to ensure that this initiative is taken forward. Limited resources should not hold back this very important social commitment.

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims at developing a conceptual framework to identify the main features of supply chain innovation and to analyse the role of dynamic capabilities in implementing such innovations in the context of the fashion-luxury industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows an exploratory approach based on one in-depth case study. The theoretical framework, developed through the literature review, is applied to a Italian fashion-luxury company, thus exploring its applicability in a real context and obtaining evidence in the area of supply chain innovation. Findings – The paper offers insights on supply chain innovation, by investigating an area under-explored in the existing literature. The paper provides a conceptual framework oriented to analyse the main features of supply chain innovation for fashion-luxury companies, by investigating the main determinants of innovation. Research limitations/implications – The proposed model provides initial insights into the topic of supply chain innovation in fashion-luxury companies. To date, the analysis is predominantly qualitative and therefore replication is needed to generalise the results. Practical implications – The paper identifies three different perspectives of supply chain innovation and the relationships between supply chain innovation and other types of innovations, which are hopefully useful for managers that are willing to introduce innovation inside fashion-luxury companies. Originality/value – The paper addresses a new topic, underexplored in the supply chain management literature, by considering a peculiar area of investigation, the fashion-luxury. Moreover, the paper investigates the topic of supply chain innovation through the support of empirical data."

Design/methodology/approach: Case studies were used to obtain rich data from three newspaper companies. The selected case study companies had experienced changes in their value chains as a result of the internet. Findings: The internet has led to falling advertising revenues and dwindling circulations. The companies reacted to this by developing online news services, which do not have the distribution costs of a physical product, enable the customisation of editorial and advertising content, and facilitate the co-creation of news content with consumers. Moving online has, however, not fully compensated for the losses in revenues. Readers were reluctant to pay for online content, the income from of the sale of web-based advertising space was significantly lower than for the printed form, and journalists resisted co-creation. Research limitations/implications: The small sample of cases limits the generalisability of the findings. Practical implications: Regional newspapers face problems developing an effective online news service to enable them to remain relevant in the communities they serve. The findings suggest that, although newspapers have adopted multimedia, and now have some user generated content, there is a reluctance to consider greater usage of additional forms of news production and e-tools. Originality/value: This paper examines how digital media are displacing physical goods from a value chain. There is evidence that co-creation, a variable so far neglected in the literature on internet supply chains, can have a critical impact on value adding/creation activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

Lack of access to technologies and information, poor infrastructure and lack of access to markets and environmental factors play a key role in deterring sustainable smallholder livestock farming. In recent years, studies have provided evidence that livestock species can play a role towards solving household food insecurity and enhancing Africa’s resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural settings. However, no studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of emerging technologies (available information technologies) as risk mitigation tools for smallholder livestock farmers. The study used survey data from 278 interviewer-administered questionnaires and 13 in-depth interviews village herds from Dumba, Mapayi, Old Nuli and Shabwe to explore whether rural SLF would use the emerging technologies to enhance their operations, and mitigate supply chain risk, exposures to stock theft and loss. Empirical results show the overwhelming need for the use of emerging technologies by the SLF, and that emerging technologies have significant and positive effects on the risk management activities. SLF indicated that, using digital technologies, they could enhance their risk mitigation and value chains. The results of the study have several policy implications. For instance, the agricultural comparative advantage should be improved through various emerging agricultural technologies. Moreover, the immediate rural development service networks for SLF could be strengthened through the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform to reduce livestock risk exposures, disasters and market reactions. Although rural livestock farming in Beitbridge has survived over the years at a subsistence level, the paper provides some interesting and pertinent findings, and projects some possible future research pathways."

Maintaining a balance between the demand for digital technology and the supply of high-tech products on the market is a basic element in the transition to a new stage of scientific and technological structure. Factors that negatively affect the development and implementation of technological, organizational and marketing innovations are identified. It is shown that the synchronization of the chain of implementation of all newly created or improved technologies ensuring the continuity of the innovation cycle requires the combined efforts of all subjects of innovation. The level of diffusion of innovative activity in federal districts of the Russian Federation is estimated. It is concluded that there is a significant differentiation of regional and sectoral intensity of innovative development. It is substantiated that in order to reduce regional differentiation when introducing advanced practices into the production process, one should take into account the type of innovative activity. According to the attractiveness for investment, digital economy instruments are divided into three categories that characterize one or another stage of their life cycle: maturity, sustainable growth, and a breakthrough trend. It was revealed that the further massive penetration of technological innovations into all links of the production chain should clearly follow the global trends of production digitalization, where the key factor for the success of innovation-oriented companies is the search for the most promising investment projects at the stage of filing a patent application.

Like tech, fashion is forward-looking and cyclical. It’s also a huge industry. The ~$2.4T fashion sector is one of the largest industries in the global economy. Research BRIEFING: Surviving the Retail Apocalypse How are brick-and-mortar retailers surviving and adapting in the world of digital commerce? Email And today, tech is transforming fashion at a faster pace than ever. From robots that sew and cut fabric, to AI algorithms that predict style trends, to VR mirrors in dressing rooms, technology is automating, personalizing, and speeding up every aspect of fashion. In this report, we dive into the trends reshaping how our clothes and accessories are designed, manufactured, distributed, and marketed.

Tech Fashions to Watch Connected jewelry, apparel, & footwear 3D scanning Novel fabrics Closing thoughts Product Design Tech is automating the fashion designer. Fashion brands of all sizes and specialties are using technology to understand customers better than ever before. Project Muse As those data collection efforts grow more sophisticated, artificial intelligence will reshape brands’ approach to product design and development, with a focus on predicting what customers will want to wear next. AI Becomes The Designer Google has already tested the waters of user-driven AI fashion design with Project Muze, an experiment it deployed in partnership with German fashion platform Zalando. The project trained a neural network to understand colors, textures, style preferences, and other “aesthetic parameters,” derived from Google’s Fashion Trends Report as well as design and trend data sourced by Zalando. From there, Project Muze used an algorithm to create designs based on users’ interests and alignment with the style preferences recognized by the network. Amazon is innovating in this area as well. One Amazon project, led by Israel-based researchers, would use machine learning to assess whether an item is “stylish” or not. Another, out of Amazon’s Lab126 R&D arm in California, would use images to learn about a particular fashion style and create similar images from scratch. If that sounds like “fast fashion by Amazon,” that’s because it probably is. The e-commerce giant has also patented a manufacturing system to support on-demand apparel-making. The tech could be used to support its Amazon Essentials line or the suppliers in Amazon’s logistics network. Of course, the outcomes of human-free AI design aren’t always runway-ready. Many designs created for users of Google’s Project Muse were just unwearable scrawls and scribbles, while some reports on the Amazon Lab126 initiative called the design results “crude.” Clearly, much more R&D is needed before brands rely on AI-only designers. But artificial intelligence is already helping brands create and iterate their designs more quickly."

In this work we first show that one fundamental role they can take regards price stability. The Economist and the Center for Financial Stability focus on the importance of regulating money supply for stable prices in a digital currency, and http://ssrn.com/abstract=2425270 designs a cryptocurrency where money supply is regulated to match money demand. This first proposal, however, has a limitation: the mechanism for stable prices implies that the amount of money in every account is continuously modified. This way the instability of prices typical of bitcoins is transferred to accounts, so that the purchasing power of savings is still less protected from inflation/deflation than in standard fiat currencies. The solution is to give wallet owners the freedom to choose how much they want to be affected by changes of money supply, by introducing two types of wallets: Inv wallets and Sav wallets. Money in Sav wallets is protected from instability thanks to the presence of Inv wallets, that take the risk, and the reward, of being the target of changes in money supply. This role of channel and cushion for monetary policy is taken by banks in fiat currencies, and is needed also in digital currencies, where it can be taken by decentralized financial intermediaries. This is a starting point to analyze the other roles that financial intermediaries can have in a digital currency, linking the ownership of Inv wallets to proof-of-stake validation of transactions and to lending.

For time and cost-efficient analysis, rapid tests capable of detecting multiple toxins from a single sample are ideal. Considering these current trends in mycotoxin testing, this project examined the feasibility of using both a portable and non-portable mass-based biosensor for multiplex mycotoxin detection. The biosensor was a mass sensitive microarray (MSMA) which consisted of 4 × 16 miniaturized mass sensitive transducer pixels based on solidly mounted resonator (SMR) technology. Functionalisation of individual pixels on the sensor surface using nano-spotting technology for the simultaneous and semi-quantitative detection of three regulated mycotoxins: T2-toxin (T2) zearalenone (ZEN), and fumonisin B1 (FumB1) was examined. With the integration of portable and non-portable microfluidic devices for antibody and standard sample injections, competitive inhibition assays were developed followed by singleplex and multiplex calibration curves. The characteristics and performance of the MSMA were evaluated including sensitivity which was determined as the concentration causing 50% inhibition. Sensitivity of singleplex assays using the portable microfluidic device (PMD) were 1.3 ng/ml, 2.0 ng/ml and 6.8 ng/ml for T2, FumB1 and ZEN, respectively. Sensitivity of the multiplex assay again using the PMD was 6.1 ng/ml, 3.6 ng/ml and 2.4 ng/ml for T2, FumB1 and ZEN, respectively. The PMD was an easy to use and highly sensitive screening tool which has been demonstrated for the multiplex detection of three regulated mycotoxins. Analysis was in real time and results were fully digital. Since detection of analytes was by mass it was both a label-free and cost-efficient method proposed method of analysis for mycotoxins."

The research topic is relevant due to the urgent need for a new, innovative approach to creating a transport and logistics system based on modern digital technologies. The authors formulate the provisions of a conceptual approach to the creation of a common digital platform characterized by the use of the integrated logistics paradigm as the basic concept of managing the interaction of market entities in the supply chain “supplier-transport company-consumer”. It serves as the basis for the introduction of telematics principles in the operational management of the transport and logistics system. We consider recommendations on the creation of joint digital platform for participants of the transport and logistics system in the context of focus on solving the problems of operational impact on the flow of goods, increasing the speed and quality of customer service. We consider the concept of “innovative transport and logistics system” and define the role of digitalization in the process of creating a transport and logistics system. To increase the efficiency of the management process of the transport and logistics system of an innovative nature on the basis of the process approach the stages of its formation have been developed. For each of the stages the authors propose to apply information technologies determined by the nature of its results. The experience of the development and implementation of innovative products in transport logistics is analyzed, the existing shortcomings are revealed, in particular, related to satellite tracking systems, the influence of the human factor on the results of operations, poor attention to the development of innovations in the transport and logistics system for the integration of warehouse and transport facilities. We conclude that while many technologies, systems and programs that allow you to track and determine the location of both the vehicle and the cargo separately are in operation, the formation of innovative transport and logistics system on a digital platform remains relevant and unresolved. When developing and implementing the stages of forming an innovative transport and logistics system, certain prerequisites should be taken into account, including organizational ones (analysis of processes and functions performed by subjects of transport and logistic interaction, creation of a regulatory legal field, development and approval of technological standards and information exchange protocols); technological (ensuring efficient online interaction during logistics operations, implementation of support for users of the CDP in the remote access mode with transaction partners; implementation of technological interfaces to systems containing transport and logistics information).

Green and lean implementation: an assessment in the automotive industry Abstract Purpose – The aim of this research work is to propose an assessment framework to evaluate businesses in terms of the implementation of a green and lean organization's supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework was developed for the assessment of green and lean implementation. The framework was designed using key criteria to identify green and lean initiatives and guidelines. This led to the development of guidelines for each criterion, and the development of a scoring method. A multiple case study of five different organizations in the automotive industry was conducted to validate the conceptual framework. Findings – The study reveals that high scores are derived from a good interaction between green and lean implementation in these companies. The results confirm that the initiatives considered in the conceptual framework appropriate to represent the green and lean assessment framework. Research limitations/implications –The case study was developed in five organizations. Validation of the model is not based on quantitative techniques. The sample size is too small. More study is need in different industry sectors. Practical implications – The proposed model can be the basis for further research on green and lean concepts, contributing to the understanding of green and lean implementation. With this assessment method, managers can evaluate their business in relation to the implementation of green and lean supply chain initiatives. Originality/value – To the author's knowledge this paper is the first to provide an assessment framework to evaluate an organization's supply chain in terms of green and lean implementation."

In order to evaluate options for further preventing and mitigating food waste in Japan, we analyzed food waste trends by estimating the disparity between calorie/protein supply and intake, and clarified the current status of waste in the Japanese food supply chain, with a view towards providing policy recommendations based on recent official published data and reports on food waste. We show that food waste measured between 1960 and 2012 in Japan can be divided into three distinct periods: low levels of food waste were observed from 1960 through the mid-1970s, increasing food waste during mid-1970s through the late-1990s, and decreasing levels of food waste since 2001. Average calorie and protein loss between food supply and intake were 22% and 15% respectively in 2012. Of total food waste in the food supply chain in 2011, 43% was recycled or reduced. Presently another 21.52 million tons could potentially be recycled or reduced by further efforts, with our data indicating that 9.52 million tons could be achieved by households, 4.24 by food business industries, 3.95 through storage and transportation, and 3.81 by agricultural producers. Accordingly, although Japan's Food Waste Recycling Law and related initiatives have made progress in encouraging recycling and waste minimization among food business industries since 2001, further efforts to systematically reduce and recycle food wastes are urgently needed across all other stages in the food supply chain, especially at the consumer level. We propose applying an evidence-based approach to food education, strengthening integrated municipal solid waste management, improving source separation of food waste by residents and related stakeholders, promoting cross-sectoral alliances and encouraging targeted commitments as strategies to prevent and mitigate food wastes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed technology designed specifically to transform business operations. The concept was introduced in a white paper by Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008. A year later, the first transaction was executed to transfer assets between two parties. Since then Blockchain has been widely adopted by the financial industry and has slowly entered other sectors, including the supply chain and healthcare. Lately, the film industry has begun exploring the benefits of implementing the technology. Blockchain could be applied to help address global health issues. For example, large enterprises such as Walmart, Nestle and Unilever have partnered with leading technology companies to reduce food contamination. Remember the e-coli outbreak experienced by Chipotle? While Blockchain might not have been able to prevent the problem, it could be used to more rapidly trace the source(s) of outbreaks. The shared behavior of the Blockchain allows organizations to not only track products within their control but also across vendors participating in the transaction, thus providing a 360-degree view to business stakeholders. The permissioned aspect of the technology would limit the required view to authorized participants. Each of these benefits, together with smart contract capability, make Blockchain attractive to leading businesses. While Blockchain has clearly been embraced by the supply chain community, there are as of yet no open standards to help ensure successful implementation. This paper focuses on providing suggested practical applications and an overview of implementation guidelines for Blockchain within the transportation marketplace."

So it is important to strengthen the management on quality and safety of agricultural products. From the perspective of supply chain of agricultural products, the paper presented a quality and safety traceability system. Firstly, the characteristics of agricultural product supply chain and system requirements were analyzed. The system adopted the architecture of multi-layer distributed system. The whole system could be divided into 6 layers including user layer, interface layer, application layer, support service layer, data layer and equipment layer. Secondly, according to the actual needs of the system, the paper illustrated business process of agricultural product supply chain. Based on the idea of the top level design in system engineering, the modular design method was adopted to divide the system main functional modules. The system could be divided into 5 subsystems which included register, production, enterprise management, government supervision and traceability subsystem. Database was the basic part of the system. On the basis of the principle of consistency, integrity, security and scalability, each table in the database was standardized in design. The QR(quick response) code was the most important part in the whole system. In order to expound the process that QR code was generated, a lot of work needed to be done. Under the guidance of HACCP(hazard analysis and critical control point) management system, and after analysis on possible dangers of the agricultural product supply chain, the paper described key factors affecting the quality and safety of agricultural products, and then encoding objects were identified. These encoding objects referred to the origin of agricultural products, product registration number, production batch and harvest batch. Based on certain rules about agricultural product encoding, each encoding object corresponded to a series of numbers. After the digital information was transformed into graphic information, the QR code came out. Each user could scan QR code through a mobile phone or computer to obtain detailed information on agricultural products. System implementation used the popular B/S architecture, took the HighCharts and jQuery as front frames; and with the help of the AJAX(asynchronous JavaScript and XML) asynchronous interaction and JSON(JavaScript object notation) data transmission technologies, this system could be successfully realized. Finally, the article showed the interfaces of some functional modules to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The system realizes the agricultural products whole supply chain of the entire process of tracking and tracing which was from the planting, harvesting and processing to the sales. The government management department could realize the on-line office work and improve the supervision efficiency through this system. Agricultural product production and management enterprises could standardize the production operation process, and improve the production management efficiency. Consumers could obtain product information through computers, mobile phones and so forth. If there was a problem of agricultural product quality and safety, consumers could protect their legitimate rights through legal channels. Development of agricultural products quality and safety traceability system was a cooperative project which was designed by Hefei University of Technology and Jiangyin Inspection and Testing Center of Agricultural Products Quality and Security. After expert evaluation, the system has passed the project acceptance."

Gucci's Autumn/Winter 2017 campaign | Source: Courtesy 104 Shares Comment BoF Professional Exclusive By BoF Team October 27, 2017 18:00 Hello BoF Professionals, your exclusive weekly briefing is ready, with members-only analysis and a digest of the week’s top news. Don't forget to download the BoF Professional iPhone app. This week, Kering announced another quarter of outstanding sales growth. Revenue was up 28.4 percent in the third quarter, reaching €3.9 billion ($4.59 billion), buoyed by a rebound in Chinese demand and a stellar performance at Gucci — the French conglomerate’s largest revenue engine — where like-for-like sales were up 49.4 percent on the strength of continued consumer enthusiasm for the designs of creative director Alessandro Michele. But as demand for Gucci’s products continues to surge, there is evidence that its supply chain can’t keep up. Indeed, on Kering’s earnings call on Tuesday, Antoine Belge, head of consumer and retail research at HSBC asked: “I think last year, there was a bit of an issue… because the demand was so strong and you had to prioritise retail versus wholesale… this year, is your supply chain more prepared for a strong Q4?” In response, Gucci has increased volume at some of its key suppliers. But the brand is planning a much bigger revamp to its production strategy that’s about more than simply keeping up with demand, said Kering chief financial officer Jean-Marc Duplaix in his presentation. “Significant investments have also been committed to the supply chain with a focus on preserving manufacturing know-how, fostering innovation, enhancing vertical integration and reducing lead time,” explained Duplaix. In early 2018 the Italian megabrand plans to open the Gucci Art Lab, a new 33,000-square-metre production centre for leather goods and shoes that Duplaix called “the pillar of our new industrial platform.” He declined to reveal the share of production that is currently internalised or outsourced, but described the new project as “huge” and “strategic”. “Clearly, it will help to increase the share of development internalised and also part of the production in leather goods and in shoes,” he said. “We also have similar initiatives at Saint Laurent, for example, where we have recently opened a factory close to Padova for the shoes, also to increase the share of internal development and production.” Kering’s moves follow in the footsteps of fast-fashion giants like Inditex, the world’s largest fashion retailer, which long ago vertically integrated its design and production processes, bringing greater speed and flexibility to its supply chain and enabling its brands — notably Zara — to be more responsive to consumer demand, thereby boosting overall productivity. Indeed, according to research by Dr Warren H. Hausman, professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, Zara’s supply chain flexibility is what makes it approximately four times more profitable than the average retailer. Zara’s integrated design and production process is often referred to as “just in time” production. The approach was pioneered by Japan’s Toyota Motor Company in 1948. In the words of Toyota, it means making “only what is needed, when it is needed and in the amount needed.” The approach is particularly relevant in trend-driven industries like fashion, where historical sales data rarely results in consistently better commercial decisions and merchandise that doesn’t sell is routinely marked down, while demand for popular items can go unmet, leading to significant loss of income. The rise of digital media only magnifies the issue. In a world where consumer expectations and trends are increasingly shaped at the speed of Instagram, “just in time” manufacturing is even more powerful. “The mismatch right now is that a digital consumer is being served by an analogue supply chain. It’s really about aligning information flows, bringing a manufacturer closer to demand visibility,” explained John S. Thorbeck, chairman of Chainge Capital, a supply chain advisory firm, earlier this year. This week German sportswear giant Adidas launched the first of six planned city-themed running shoe models made at its new “Speedfactory” in the Bavarian town of Ansbach, where the company is deploying new processes like robotic cutting, computerised knitting and 3D printing. “It’s a hyper- flexible shoe factory concept that can be placed anywhere in the world. It enables us to combine speed in manufacturing with the flexibility to rethink conventional processes to give consumers what they want when they want it,” explained Gerd Manz, the company’s head of technology innovation, earlier this year. “It allows us to react quickly to consumer demands and changing trends. The vision is to reduce lead times from months to weeks to days or hours. Consumers today live in a constantly changing world. This shapes their behaviour and expectations. They demand newness and immediacy without compromise.” As the luxury fashion industry continues to debate the merits of “see now, buy now”, it’s increasingly clear that the future of fashion immediacy has less to do with aligning product drops with the pre-planned consumer marketing spikes generated by fashion shows and more to do with the speed and flexibility required to be able to deliver new product — “what’s needed, when it is needed and in the amount needed” — in response to the year-round ebb and flow of digital trends on platforms like Instagram. And while the creative energy of a designer like Gucci’s Alessandro Michele can certainly boost the fortunes of a brand, in today’s fashion world, technology-driven supply chains are becoming as important as design."

Most of these developments have the same root cause: a shift in product development from the time-worn focus on physical products to a comprehensive consideration of actual patient needs. While this sounds very simple, it has to be understood in the context of an industry where the patients as the end customers traditionally have been neither in direct contact with producers nor able to make buying decisions regarding complex drugs on their own. However, innovative (sometimes even individualized) drugs and new information technologies require and enable new information flows and affect traditional supply chain configurations. Industry dynamics are currently driven by the emergence of biosimilars, therapeutically differentiated drugs, increasingly complex transportation requirements, new possibilities for patient compliance monitoring, and digital transformation of supply chain business processes. This series of five articles sheds light on current industry developments and their rationales, and elaborates on their implications for various supply chain components. This first installment in the series emphasizes trends and paradigm shifts in supply chain management that can be observed now. A range of perspectives providing detailed descriptions will be found in subsequent articles and enriched by short case studies illustrating, e.g., regional particularities, future value-added services, postponement strategies, and supply chain segmentation approaches."

These electronic components are manufactured by supply chain rather than by hearing aid manufacturers. Manufacturers can use custom-designed components or generic off-the-shelf components. These electronic components are available as application-specific or off-the-shelf products, with the former designed for a specific manufacturer and the latter for a generic approach. The choice of custom or generic components will affect the product specifications, pricing, manufacturing, life cycle, and marketing strategies of the product. The World Health Organization is interested in making available to developing countries hearing aids that are inexpensive to purchase and maintain. The hearing aid presented in this article was developed with these specifications in mind together with additional contemporary features such as four channels with wide dynamic range compression, an adjustable compression rate for each channel, four comfort programs, an adaptive feedback manager, and full volume control.

This is particularly due to the transparency and traceability characteristic of a short supply chain and social aspects related to food origins. The trend has been increasingly common during the past decade in Europe and North America, and it is strongly evident in the case area of this study in Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland. In general, ease of access to food is highly important for consumers and crucial for institutional kitchens, in addition to quality aspects and price. However, regardless of proximity, poor accessibility is one of the key issues preventing the further growth of local food markets. Due to scale economics in food value chain, food transport is presently organised mainly by centralised, large-scale logistics companies directed via hubs serving millions of consumers. Accordingly, production volumes required to enter large-scale markets are often unattainable for disjointed small-scale local food producers. In this study, geographic information system (GIS)-based accessibility analyses are applied for analysing potential for integral networking of local food production and transport companies. Berry production was selected as a case study because it has a relatively strong role in Northern Ostrobothnia, while its logistics are notably underdeveloped. Spatial data of primary production volumes consists of register records of farm-specific cultivation areas and average yields in Northern Ostrobothnia and Finland. Accessibility computations are based on the digital model of the Finnish road network, Digiroad. Two surveys were also implemented to farmers and food processing companies to seek views on food processing, sales, logistics and procurements regarding local food. Data from the surveys was used in accessibility analysis, which enables exploration of opportunities for establishing 'local food' clusters integrating small producers into a more effective and competitive network. Information about favourable conditions for cooperative networks in the local food sector may help in establishing companies and their growth. Again, successful networking may increase scale economies in local production in transport, processing and marketing."

Incumbent ITOs are now competing with emerging entrants that are responsive to customer needs because of their digital expertise. As the various provider categories have become less clear and as barriers to entry have fallen, tour service suppliers must consider the contemporary tourism “ecosystem” when formulating strategies. In the face of declining consumer demand for standardized tour products, there is an urgent need to consider changing tourist habits or tastes when introducing new in-destination options. In exploring the evolving features of the inbound tourism ecosystem, this paper draws upon the recent literature to focus on the distinguishing characteristics of innovative tour service and experiences.

However, these therapies can be complicated and expensive to deliver due to their sensitivity to environment; troublesome tissue, cell, or genetic material sourcing; and complicated regulatory requirements. Objective: This study aims to create a novel connected supply chain logistics and manufacturing management platform based on blockchain, with cell and gene therapy as a use case. Objectives are to define the requirements and perform feasibility evaluations on the use of blockchain for standardized manufacturing and establishment of a chain of custody for the needle-to-needle delivery of autologous cell and gene therapies. A way of lowering overall regulatory compliance costs for running a network of facilities operating similar or parallel processes will be evaluated by lowering the monitoring costs through publishing zero-knowledge proofs and product release by exception. Methods: The study will use blockchain technologies to digitally connect and integrate supply chain with manufacturing to address the security, scheduling, and communication issues between advanced therapy treatment centers and manufacturing facilities in order to realize a transparent, secure, automated, and cost-effective solution to the delivery of these life-saving therapies. An agile software development methodology will be used to develop, implement, and evaluate the system. The system will adhere to the EU and US good manufacturing practices and regulatory requirements. Results: This is a proposed study protocol, and upon acceptance, grant funding will be pursued for its execution in 2021. Conclusions: The successful implementation of the integrated blockchain solution to supply chain and manufacturing of advanced therapies can push the industry standards toward a safer and more secure therapy delivery process."

The case of Walmart Chile is illustrative of how the reconfiguration of spaces of urban mass consumption and the organizational restructuring of agro-industrial hinterlands constitute each other in intricate ways. An agrarian question of circulation, the paper concludes, bears important political implications for rethinking the scope and extent of contemporary discussions on agrarian reform being put forward by transnational rural organizations."

However, this increased access to the means of distribution comes with increased responsibilities; musicians not only write, record and produce their own music, in the digital era, they are charged with the added responsibility of promoting, circulating and distributing their music. To understand this disruption, this essay presents the conceptual framework of the artist-as-intermediary. Suturing the artist to the intermediary, the artist-as- intermediary articulates the ways in which the responsibilities formerly held by music label executives — promoters, managers, A&R representatives ­— have not disappeared with disintermediation but have instead been downloaded onto the musician.

The proposed ADMFC uses dedicated high-speed carry chain paths in an FPGA to finely adjust the clock frequency by controlling the number of carry propagations on the carry chain logics (CARRY4 cells) in the delay line of a ring oscillator. Moreover, supply voltage variation and noise caused by circuit switchings can be compensated by dynamically adjusting the length of ripple carry propagations on the cascaded CARRY4 cells in response to the detected voltage variation. Finally, a selectable modulation profile is devised to provide a much suitable profile between two different profiles at run-time for the given noise constraints and working environment of a chip. Measurement results show that at the frequency of 44.6MHz, the ADMFC can obtain 17dB and 19.4dB EMI attenuations with a 7.5% spreading ratio when using triangular and sawtooth profiles, respectively.

These processes require highly qualified and specially trained engineering and technical personnel. The rapid development of digital technologies and their implementation in the technological processes for ensuring flights of aircraft aviation fuel, such as continuous monitoring of fuel cleanliness, the quantity and consumption records of aircraft aviation fuel using automated systems, as well as the use of new equipment, such as mass meters, which are highly accurate. All this requires a new approach to the training of the refueling complexes personnel. In addition, the development of refueling complexes is on the way to optimize the operations. So, for example, the responsibilities of the aircraft refueling operator are also assigned to the driver of the refueling tanker. Currently, the technical facilities of the warehouse and refueling complex equipment used for aircraft refueling are included as part of the airport infrastructure in order to ensure the flights regularity. Application of the new equipment using digital technologies is associated with improving the quality of refueling operations at all stages of aviation fuel supply. To ensure effective management of aviation fuel supply processes at all stages, the organizational structure should be based not only on modern equipment of all parts of the technological chain of fuel preparation, but also on a closed automated control system based on the introduction of modern, intelligent control and measuring devices. In these conditions, the issue of training personnel of fueling complexes becomes relevant. The solution to this issue is in the development of automated training systems, that allow to accelerate staff training and reduce the cost of training. Therefore, the article discusses the structural and functional model of an automated training system (ATS) that combines disparate solutions and forms a new system for solving problems of training, certification and information support for personnel of aviation fuel supply organizations (AFSO). The proposed training system allows training not only for one workplace, but taking into account individual characteristics, for example, to prepare both the driver of the vehicle and the refueling operator in one person. The article describes the scenarios of the use of ATS subsystems developed in the work, which determine the basic functional composition. In conclusion, based on the developed scenarios for the use of subsystems, the developed structural and functional model of the ATS is presented, which provides solutions to the problems of maintaining the operation of the AFSO and supporting decision-making."

Unlike the conventional linear error calibration method, the nonlinear error of the PTAT current under the low temperature range is fully characterized based on the device model files provided by the foundry. Simulation has been performed, which clearly shows the nonlinear model is much more accurate than the linear model. A nonlinear error calibration method, which requires only two-point calibration, is then proposed.

These models have been around for a while-so what is different now? We have identified three important changes: (1) Data: availability of internal and external real-time data such as traffic to a website, consumers making buy/no buy decisions and competitor pricing strategies; (2) Analytics: advances in machine learning and ease of access (R, Python) have enabled the development of systems that learn on the fly about consumer behaviour and preferences and generate effective estimates of demand-price relationships; and (3) Automation: increase in computing speed enables real-time optimisation of prices of hundreds of competing products sold by the same retailer. We take advantage of these new opportunities by showing how they were applied at Boston-based flash sales retailer Rue La La, online market maker Groupon, and the largest online retailer in Latin America, B2W Digital (B2W). While all these examples are of on-line businesses which have readily available data and can change prices dynamically, we have also implemented similar methods for brick-and-mortar retailed in applications such as promotional pricing, new product introduction, and assortment optimisation with similar business impacts. Thus, beyond applications to price optimisations, these new trends enable companies to revolutionise their business from procurement to supply chain all the way to revenue management."

Additionally, the challenges of assessing asset conditions against maintenance schedules and logistical constraints must be met. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is at the heart of this transformation. It connects people, machines, items, and services to streamline the flow of information, enable real-time decisions, and open new opportunities in mining and metals. Leading companies are already investing billions in the Industrial Internet of Things and realizing returns that range from increased asset uptime and efficient predictive maintenance to autonomous fleets of vehicles able to move more goods. This paper will be talking about various digital applications available for the Metals and Mining industry. Companies can use advanced analytics to extract management-relevant information from the large amounts of unstructured data that they generate. This information can then be used to improve how mines are run and to make better-informed and speedier decisions across the full range of the mining business processes. The applications start from design & engineering followed by supply chain management, production & maintenance management, transport & logistics management.

Often unknowingly, people deliver up commercially-valuable personal information as a condition of online user experience, functionality and access. Websites are increasingly tracking user behaviours for commercial purposes and social media derives its income largely from data collection and advertising targeted to the personal disclosures and behavioural attributes which are its data-production mainstay. In this context, consumers face a plethora of information collection practices, all designed to generate data analytics including inferential and predictive profiling to create a 'digital identity' for OBA purposes. In this subterranean exchange, consumers are economically redefined as data subjects and advertising targets; a reframing which is perhaps why the OBA industry faces a crisis in consumer concern, both as to privacy and trust. This paper proposes that the regulatory control of OBA in Australia is in disarray. Consumer ignorance of online privacy management and OBA practices is demonstrable. Industry transparency, disclosure, consent processes and compliance practices are questionable. Regulator interest is minimal, industry self-regulation is weak and consumer technical ability and personal responsibility is a last fragile line of defence. Data breaches are ubiquitous in a crowded and poorly-audited supply chain, and entail significant adverse consumer consequences. Yet despite these serious concerns, Australian regulators are failing to respond to OBA issues, either through mandating greater industry disclosure or through regulatory action. The author seeks to expose these weaknesses in calling for consumer and privacy regulators to take more meaningful action to better protect consumers' interests online."

However, detailed quantitative field-based studies concerning the response to these external forcing mechanisms are scarce, particularly on the scale of entire islands. The Mississippi – Alabama barrier island chain, located along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico coastline has lost land on the order of hectares per year since records began in the 1840s, putting mainland coastal communities and important ecosystems at risk. Here we present an analysis of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital elevation models, revealing erosional/depositional patterns and geomorphologic changes around the most vulnerable of these islands, Ship Island. Four LiDAR datasets (2004, 2007, 2010, and 2012), capturing the complete topography of the island and some bathymetry in the inlet and surrounding shallows to depths of up to 8 m, are used to investigate subaerial and subaqueous sediment volume changes between these years. The impact of Hurricane Katrina, which produced the highest storm surge ever recorded in the United States, is captured in the 2004–2007 dataset. During this time, sediment comparable to 1.5 times the 2004 subaerial island volume was lost from the area included in the topographic/bathymetric dataset. Only 1/5 of this volume was recovered to this area between 2007 and 2010. The island returned to a state of sediment loss between 2010 and 2012, albeit within the error bounds, while the areal extent of the islands continued to increase. This study examines the impact severe storm events can have on vulnerable barrier islands. It highlights the importance of utilizing 3D datasets that include both topographic and bathymetric data for morphodynamic analyses of barrier island systems."

The third was driven by electronics and the application of information technology and increased automated production. The fourth revolution sees technology embed itself further in society with digital technological advances connecting all the major stakeholders in the core manufacturing activities. Industry 4.0 is a combined integrated seamless connected network of machines, production processes, and the manufacturing control systems. It is a digital manufacturing enterprise with the physical product at the core driven by information from an integrated information network among the internal stakeholders, as well as external entities, such as customers, suppliers, etc. This digitization of physical assets and manufacturing activities along with a network of digital communications is fundamentally changing the manufacturing industry landscape. This end-to-end digitization is improving process efficiency, quality management, and productivity along with real-time insights into the whole manufacturing landscape, building a digital business model that supports data-driven decision-making and integrated platform-based services. The use cases of Industry 4.0 include supply chain, marketing, and services, R&D of manufacturing engineering services, and other areas, but most of the opportunities and interest today are in the core manufacturing activities.

Sensitive consumer information is often being sold downstream in this ecosystem without the knowledge of consumers, and in many cases to their annoyance. While this practice, in cases, may result in long-term benefits for the consumers, it can result in serious information privacy breaches of very significant impact (e.g., breach of genetic data) in the short term. The question we raise through this paper is: Is it economically feasible to trade consumer personal information with their formal consent (permission) and in return provide them incentives (monetary or otherwise)?. In view of (a) the behavioral assumption that humans are 'compromising' beings and have privacy preferences, (b) privacy as a good not having strict boundaries, and (c) the practical inevitability of inappropriate data leakage by data holders downstream in the data-release supply-chain, we propose a design of regulated efficient/bounded inefficient economic mechanisms for oligopoly data trading markets using a novel preference function bidding approach on a simplified sellers-broker market. Our methodology preserves the heterogeneous privacy preservation constraints (at a grouped consumer, i.e., app, level) upto certain compromise levels, and at the same time satisfies information demand (via the broker) of agencies (e.g., advertising organizations) that collect client data for the purpose of targeted behavioral advertising."

Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied."

Open source appropriate technology (OSAT) can over-come this challenge, but one of the key impediments to the more rapid development and distri-bution of OSAT is the lack of means of production beyond a specific technical complexity. This study designs and demonstrates the technical viability of two open-source mobile digital manufacturing facilities powered with solar photovoltaics, and capable of printing customizable OSAT in any com-munity with access to sunlight. The first, designed for community use, such as in schools or maker-spaces, is semi-mobile and capable of nearly continuous 3-D printing using RepRap technology, while also powering multiple computers. The second design, which can be completely packed into a standard suitcase, allows for specialist travel from community to community to provide the ability to custom manufacture OSAT as needed, anywhere. These designs not only bring the possibility of complex manufacturing and replacement part fabrication to isolated rural communities lacking access to the electric grid, but they also offer the opportunity to leap-frog the entire conventional manufacturing supply chain, while radically reducing both the cost and the environmental impact of products for developing communities."

The research informs ways in which practitioners can fully embrace the potential of BIM for energy efficiency to promote sustainable interventions by improving existing training practices and identifying new training requirements as BIM evolves and as practitioners’ ICT (Information and Communications Technology) maturity levels improve. This is achieved by adopting a novel text-mining approach which analyses social media alongside secondary sources of evidence to establish a level of correlation between BIM roles and skills. The use of ontological dependency analysis has helped to understand the degree of correlation of skills with roles as a method to inform training and educational programmes. A key outcome from the research is a semantic web-based mining environment which determines BIM roles and skills, as well as their correlation factor, with an application for energy efficiency. The paper also evidences that (a) construction skills and roles are dynamic in nature and evolve over time, reflecting the digital transformation of the Construction industry, and (b) the importance of socio-organisational aspects in construction skills and related training provision.

Abstract In today's world, supply chain management (SCM) is a key strategic factor for increasing organizational effectiveness and for better realization of organizational goals such as enhanced competitiveness, better customer care and increased profitability. The era of both globalization of markets and outsourcing has begun, and many companies select supply chain and logistics to manage their operations. Most of these companies realize that, in order to evolve an efficient and effective supply chain, SCM needs to be assessed for its performance. Based on a literature survey, an attempt has been made in this paper to develop a framework for measuring the strategic, tactical and operational level performance in a supply chain. In addition, a list of key performance metrics is presented. The emphasis is on performance measures dealing with suppliers, delivery performance, customer-service, and inventory and logistics costs in a SCM. In developing the metrics, an effort has been made to align and relate them to customer satisfaction."

Abstract Purpose – Supply chain risk management assumes importance in the wake of organizations understanding that their risk susceptibility is dependent on other constituents of their supply chain. The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to effective supply chain risk mitigation by understanding the dynamics between various enablers that help to mitigate risk in a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Using interpretive structural modeling the research presents a hierarchy-based model and the mutual relationships among the enablers of risk mitigation. Findings – The research shows that there exists a group of enablers having a high driving power and low dependence requiring maximum attention and of strategic importance while another group consists of those variables which have high dependence and are the resultant actions.

Newly developed digital reader-based techniques require test evaluations before their clinical application. Methods: Two types of digital influenza RDTs using a digital readout system and one conventional RDT were compared using 314 nasopharyngeal swabs of influenza. The swabs originated from symptomatic individuals suspected of influenza infection, and the presence of influenza was confirmed with influenza real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and influenza subtyping. Methods were the Sofia® Influenza A + B Fluorescence Immunoassay (FIA), which uses a portable fluorescence analyser, the BD Veritor™ System Flu A + B, which uses a colorimetric immunochromatographic method with a reflectance-based measurement digital device, and the SD Bioline assay, which is based on a traditional immunochromatographic method. Results: The Sofia® Influenza A + B system, the BD Veritor™ System Flu A + B and the SD Bioline assay showed sensitivities in relative real-time PCR results of 74.2, 73.0 and 53.9%, respectively, for influenza A, and 82.5, 72.8 and 71.0%, respectively, for influenza B. All three RDTs showed 100% specificities for influenza A and influenza B. The Sofia® Influenza A + B Fluorescence Immunoassay showed sensitive and specific results for the detection of influenza B in contrast to the BD Veritor™ System Flu A + B. The two digital RDTs showed higher sensitivity and specificity than the conventional RDT in the detection of the influenza H3 subtype. Conclusions: Digital-based readout systems for the detection of the influenza virus can be applied for more sensitive diagnosis in clinical settings than conventional RDTs."

This paper presents a monolithic frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) SAR transceiver that works at Ku-band and centers at 15 GHz. Techniques to address the special requirements of UAV SAR are proposed. A digital-tunable mixed-signal-mode FMCW chirp synthesizer is designed to be power efficient, to provide a tunable chirp rate, and to enable digital minimization of the root-mean-square (RMS) frequency errors. A saturated driver-amplifier-power-amplifier chain and an input-load peak-staggering low-noise amplifier are implemented to nullify the ripple effects so that the degradations of imaging performances can be prevented. Moreover, a 12th order active-RC bandpass filter is used to suppress the intermediate frequency interferences of both ground reflections and antenna leakage. A binary-weighted programmable gain amplifier and a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter are also integrated into the chip. Fabricated using a 65-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology, the prototype demonstrates 1.48-GHz chirp bandwidth and <186-kHz rms frequency errors in a programmable modulation period from 1.18 to 10 ms. The transmitter and receiver RF front end attains 1.1- and 0.51-dB ripples, respectively. The function of the FMCW SAR transceiver is validated through the delay line and near-field ranging tests. The SAR imaging experiment with a distance of around 110 m is successfully carried out using the chip prototype and a range migration algorithm. At 1.2-V supply, the transceiver chip consumes 259.4 mW."

The following question is addressed: Why has disruption in the recording industry not followed the patterns of generic examples from other sectors? The purpose of this paper is to describe and explain why the digital disruption does not lead to the disruption of all types of companies. Design/methodology/approach: This longitudinal study is based on a large set of secondary sources combined with in-depth interviews in Sweden’s recording industry. Findings: Findings indicate that when customers turn to streaming, the major record companies’ direct control of which music the consumer is exposed to increases. This main finding contrasts statements that streaming services would facilitate peer-to-peer sharing activities between music customers and make record companies redundant. The major record companies have remained at a prosperous position due to the control of valuable content and marketing assets, as well as asymmetric interdependency among parties in the supply chain. Research limitations/implications: The recording industry is different to many other sectors based on the latent value of catalogues, and the conclusions drawn from this paper should thereby not be taken for granted for other industries. Practical/implications: Findings suggest that by “reading” the development of the industry and understanding what key resources create dependencies and revenue flows, managers would be better at tackling disruption.

The whole system was fabricated in a 0.18-μhbox m standard CMOS process and operates under 1 V for analog blocks and ADC, and 1.8 V for digital modules. The number of active recording channels is programmable and the digital output data rate changes accordingly, leading to high system power efficiency.

The methodlogy of the research includes system theory that gives grounds to consider logistics distribution centres as a system in order to further structure and analyse it. Prognostic methods are used to detect possible trends and examine prospects of integrated logistics centres’ development. The author argues that it is necessary to create an integrated distribution centre as the principal link, in a logistics chain of agricultural products’ movement from producer to consumer. Having reviewed scholarly approaches to the content of the concept “logistics centre”, the author concludes about the relevance of creation of integrated logistics centre and proves the necessity to introduce modern digital blockchain and RFID technologies into the logistics of goods as a new trend in the development of logistics systems. The author studies the importance of these technologies for optimising the costs, reducing the time for logistic business processes, increasing agricultural traceability, preventing possible risks in all links of the supply chain of agricultural products.

In the last decade, several academics and practitioners have predicted the rise of what is called enterprise resource planning systems II (ERP II). ERP II was sought to be a digital platform that is capable of supporting timely decision-making through covering all business functions’ processes through having preloaded modules that will minimize the need for external systems like separate customer relationship management (CRM), e-business platforms, and supply chain management (SCM) systems, among others. While ERP systems nowadays have matured, and several packages come with CRM modules and other solutions, however separate CRM systems are still widely adopted by organizations. Thus, this study investigates why organizations that currently have ERPs with CRM modules are still investing in separate CRM systems. Our results show that the current ERP systems did not reach the ERP II state as envisioned, as most organizations are inclined to adopt separate CRM systems. Thus, we have presented five main reasons for this inclination, which are: scoping during ERP implementations, costs, features and functionalities, user-friendliness and ease of use, and finally integration with e-business platforms."

Blockchain technology has gained widespread traction and is attracting investments like no other emerging technology [1]. A growing number of use cases are being discussed and tested across a range of industries, including finance, insurance, healthcare, logistics and supply chain management. Gartner recently placed blockchain technology just shy of the "" peak of inflated expectations "" in their hype cycle for emerging technologies for 2016 [2] with another 5 to 10 years before we see mainstream adoption. But beyond the hype, should BPM practitioners care about it? Blockchain is perhaps best known as the technology underpinning bitcoin, but its potential applications go well beyond enabling digital currencies. Blockchain enables a potentially evolving and open set of parties to maintain a safe, permanent, and tamper-proof digital ledger of transactions, without a central authority. The key to the technology is that transactions are not recorded centrally. Instead, each party maintains a copy of the ledger. A majority of parties need to approve (verify) a new transaction before it can be recorded in the ledger – according to a notion of majority that varies depending on the specific technology. Once a transaction is approved , it is practically impossible to change it or remove it. Hence, blockchain technology can be seen as a replicated append-only transactional data store, and hence it can be used as a substitute for centralized registers maintained by single trusted authorities. However, we know from history that a mere technology substitution renders relatively limited value. In the 1980s and 1990s, the coming of age of client-server architectures and the Internet made it possible to automate a wide range of processes. Businesses learned however (sometimes the hard way), that process automation per se rarely or never produced significant value. Instead, the value of process automation came from the fact that it enabled fundamentally new business process improvement opportunities – such as once-only data capture (using shared data stores), automated business rules validation, and online self-service. Likewise, the business potential for blockchain technology lies not so much in its technology substitution ability, but rather in its ability to enable new business process improvement opportunities."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the prerequisites and effects of centralised supply chain planning at IKEA, and to explore how the planning process, planning system, and planning organization make up a centralised planning approach. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a longitudinal case study of IKEA's implementation of global supply chain planning. The literature review generated a framework which identifies prerequisites for, approaches to, and the effects of and obstacles to centralised supply chain planning. This framework was used to analyse IKEA's supply chain planning before and after the implementation. Finally, the authors reflected upon the learning from IKEA and refined the framework. Findings – A number of prerequisites for centralised supply chain planning were identified: functional products, vertical integration, a dominating organization possessing the power and competence to enforce the implementation, and the use of one planning domain possessing all critical planning information. The direct effects of centralised supply chain planning were related to supply chain integration, standardisation, specialisation, and learning effects. Implementing centralised supply chain planning in an appropriate planning context led to several operational performance improvements. Obstacles were mainly related to human and organizational, as well as to software and data issues. Research limitations/implications – This is a first approach towards development of a framework of how to design, use and benefit from centralised supply chain planning. The developed conceptual model, which is refined through the case study, offers some generalizability in researching centralised supply chain planning. Practical implications – The findings show that centralised supply chain planning is a necessity for a large and growing, global supply chain striving for low-cost production and efficiency. Originality/value – IKEA is a unique case with its supply chain characteristics and recently implemented planning concept."

Fundamentally, blockchain is a distributed ledger of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. That information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, but is decentralised and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government, and once published, the information on the blockchain cannot be changed. Make no mistake, blockchain has arrived, offering immense opportunity for industry to become more effective, transparent, productive and sustainable. But what is it, and how do businesses, engineers and built environment professionals even begin to think about how they could capitalise upon this potential? That is where this report steps in to offer some clarity, direction and signal the opportunity presented by blockchain technology in construction. This includes smart contracts; payment and project management; procurement and supply chain management; BIM and smart asset management; and the challenges ahead for implementation. ICE’s Professional Skills (2018) report recognised the opportunities and challenges that continue to be presented by the introduction of digital technology and the profound effect that it will have on the work of civil engineers in the coming years, in both the construction and operation of infrastructure assets. In continuing this work, I would like to thank the report author, Bálint Pénzes, COWI UK Limited, and the many contributors to this Insights report for sharing their considerable knowledge and experience of the disruptive potential, application and adoption of blockchain technology. We are at a very early stage of blockchain’s inception, and we ask you to begin thinking about your systems, business and processes. What could change? And could blockchain be right for you?"

However, in the NTV regime, the existing timing models are based on arbitrarily chosen VDD-dependent threshold points for effective current calculation that results in unreliability. In this article, an effective current delay model for an inverter operating in NTV regime is presented using supply-independent threshold points. The model is developed considering the input-output coupling capacitance and by relating the input and output currents of an inverter stage. This approach is physics-/topology-based and is valid for different technologies. This has been verified against HSPICE simulations and Synopsys Sentaurus 3-D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations for STM 65-nm MOSFETs and 16-nm fin-shaped field-effect transistors (FinFETs), respectively, at different supply voltages, considering variation in threshold voltage and at different operating temperatures. The model predicts the transition delay values with an average (maximum) error of 3% (6%) and 4% (6%) for MOSFET and FinFET, respectively. Furthermore, the model is employed for digital buffer chain and single-ended ring oscillators (SEROs) for a wide range of supply voltages. Finally, we show an application of the model to calculate the change in the oscillation frequency of SERO with PVT variations and compare the same with the time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations."

Thenceforward the music production, distribution and sales have changed to a digitization era. Artists, recording companies and the retail needed to reinvent their competencies to meet the new behavioral needs of the music consumer. Introduction This article is the first part of the doctoral thesis that will be based in the new format of the music supply chain from the standpoint of the consumer, artist and music industry. This paper will research the participants of the musical supply chain (music industry, musicians, distributors, retailers and consumers) were affected with music digitization. A milestone for the change in the consumption pattern of the music was Napster site, which at the end of the twentieth century made possible the exchange of music files easy, quickly, convenient and free. Since the Napster development, record labels and musicians found themselves cornered with the new music exchange format since physical disks, usually in the form of Compact Disc (CDs) would no longer be necessary for performance their products (music), thereby they lose control over their work product and therefore the physical distribution chain, controlled by record companies would present as a exceeded music exchange model. On the other hand, some musicians realized that this moment started the ""democratization"" of information via digital media. No more ties with some record label to record labels are needed by the musicians. With the music digitization, press, distribution and promotion of the artist by a major label is no more necessary; thus the current technology enables anyone to make the whole process of development of music in your own home by using appropriate software. Nor is it necessary to record more music on physical media with a CD since the digital music can be transmitted from computer to computer, person to person, reducing the need for any artist to be dependent on a label.

Abstract This article analyzes how globalization and ICTs change the way companies operate by generating a new economy called digital economy, where new concepts such as Digital Business have been generated. This transformation is characterized by the change in the supply-demand relationship that requires companies to implement new technologies in their business models to be part of the global market. In this scenario; micro, small and medium enterprises have proved to be the most affected by not being able to adapt to these accelerated changes. A clear example of this is the footwear sector in Bogotá, which has faced a decrease in the last few years. Demand evidenced in the fall of the indicators in production, sales and employment. According to this, the objective is to identify the role that Digital Business can play in increase the demand of the MIPYMES of the footwear sector in Bogotá. To achieve this, we analyzed: Digital Business and its main components; the current situation of MIPYMES in the country; the footwear sector in Colombia-Bogotá and the current panorama of the adoption of new technologies by these companies. In this way, they were identified the main factors that generate a decrease in demand in the sector were identified. Finally, it´s proposed how from the Porter value chain model these companies can increase demand through the integration of Digital Business."

The AOCL generates electrically equivalent offset capacitance and enables charge-domain fine calibration using a 10-bit R-2R digital-to-analog converter, charge-transfer switches, and a charge-storing capacitor. The AOCL cancels the unwanted offset by binary-search algorithm based on 10-bit successive approximation register (SAR) logic.

At present, business organization are moving towards Industry 5.0 (internet of thought) and GIG economy where the traditional way of fully relying on full time workers are no longer relevant. The world of work is changing. From organizational view, leap frogging strategy with technological advancement are significant to achieve competitive advantage to ensure the continuity of business. While from worker perspective, having technology driven talent is a must to face new business economy called as GIG economy. In other words, all workers in every industry including logistics should ensure they have technology driven talent in his/her portfolio to remain competitive in the working world. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the applicability of Industry 5.0 such as digitalization and mobile marketing to logistics players; to make them more visible to customer and competitor. Single case study method was adopted to study on the perspective as discussed above more in-depth. Findings from this single case study is transferable as it provides rich explanation and discussion from one of the earliest logistics company in Malaysia, with logistics experience almost five (5) decades in providing logistics services. The qualitative findings pointed out four key areas for LSP improvement. Firstly, all LSPs should go for transition process with their business model to provide them with new revenue - logistics digital business and allow them to be more visible to their customer by fully utilizing the promotion activities online. Secondly, every agreement with customer should be put into contract and it is paperless within system. Thirdly, digital payment is a must to all logistics players to practice in order for them to compete in digital era. Finally, and inevitability, to sustain in the business, logistics may move to become intelligent logistics players with carrying no asset and just focus on negotiating contracts with customers. This term refers to practising logistics players with no assets or less assets centric. In principle, the company does not own asset but able to provide logistics services (for example fleet and warehouses) by aggregating ""information about assets"" from people who do own them by leveraging on data. This article contributes to the logistics study by matching issue on digitalization and GIG economy in logistics sector. More work on future of logistics is needed with large sample across the globe in order to obtain more data to help the logistics players depict themselves in new economy."

Car manufacturing is now at its highest level since 2005, exports are stronger than ever and the UK can boast an increasingly competitive supply chain, with cars built in Britain now having over 15% more UK content than they did five years ago. The sector is, however, on the cusp of dramatic change. Technology is creating a host of opportunities which allow for new innovations and the development of cleaner, more efficient and safer vehicles. The rapid development of the digital economy is changing consumer expectations and old business models are being adapted, changed and even scrapped as a result. And political change is creating new challenges for the automotive sector as the UK prepares for its withdrawal from the European Union. In the face of all this change, the primary objective of the automotive sector stays the same – to remain globally competitive. So the opportunities presented by the digitalisation of manufacturing will be critical. Many manufacturers are already embracing digitalisation by taking advantage of increasingly affordable technologies, such as sensors, using these to connect their factories and drawing on the data produced to improve processes and products. Digitalisation can help manufacturers save time, reduce costs and respond more effectively to customer demand, all as part of the culture of innovation and continuous improvement that is within the DNA of the automotive sector. By fully embracing digitalisation, the automotive sector stands to gain £6.9bn every year by 2035. The cumulative total benefit to the economy could be £74bn by 2035. This is a significant prize, but there are challenges that need to be overcome, by the sector and by government, if it is to be realised. The UK's digital infrastructure needs to be improved, clear policies on cyber security must be developed, the skills gap must be addressed and investment in digitalisation must be accelerated."

Leading actors along the maritime supply chain were asked to indicate the importance and to assess the degree of the success achieved in each ICT innovation initiative, to identify the driving forces behind the adoption of innovation and to denote the associated costs and benefits. This input allows identifying the barriers of digital innovation from initiation through to implementation, as well as assessing the impact of facilitators of ICT innovation. To do this, the present research combines four quantitative instruments. The added value of this combined approach is a deeper understanding of the digital innovation process within the port sector. The research firstly indicates that alignment exists between company strategies and success degrees in the port sector, in contrast to non-ICT initiatives. The ICT innovation initiatives are also profit driven. Secondly, the port sector should be more open to disclose cost and benefit information and should conduct more such analyses. Next, there are conditions that improve the degree of success. Overall, terminal alignment with the right ICT infrastructure proves key. However, too many divergent interests among the stakeholders entail that digital innovation challenges the ability to cooperate. An important finding is regulation was not identified as a barrier nor as a facilitator."

Four approaches on the new occurrence are presented. According to John Howkins theory, the fifteen creative industries (listed by the author) are the core of the creative economy. Both creativity and economy aren’t new, but brand new are its interaction and scope. A wide definition of creativity has formed Richard Florida’s theory of the developing creative class, which is a group of professionals, researchers and artists whose presence creates socioeconomic and cultural dynamism in cities especially. Richard Caves characterizes creative industries on the basis of seven economic properties and presents an idea that creative industries as such aren’t unique but the sectors of creative industries driven by creativity generate new approaches to business processes, the demand-supply chain and covers both economic and social indicators of the country development. Charles Landry has proposed a creative city concept, which states that cities are dependent on one resource only – its people. Creativity changes place, natural resources, market access, and becomes the key to dynamism of city development. A creative city defines a metropolis with variety of cultural activities glued to urban economical and social functioning. Key activities highly influencing rapid growth of the creative industries worldwide are related to both technology and economy. Digital revolutions and economic environments where revolutions took place, changes in technology and communications altogether have formed new conditions for development of creative economy as a new economic phenomenon."

Lacking a homogeneous literature background, case studies often fall into storytelling, providing mere descriptions of the facts according to the writers' impressions and opinions. We therefore investigate blockchain adoption for sustainable purposes through a case study while remaining firmly grounded in three main theoretical literature streams: knowledge management, knowledge infrastructure, and trust. Since blockchain interaction with the real world is managed by oracles, addressing the oracle problem is essential in order to evaluate the effectiveness of blockchain for sustainability issues. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no other paper has efficiently addressed this subject or even mentioned it. Recognizing its scarce consideration in the literature, the oracle problem will be analyzed in both theoretical and practical terms, thereby providing a way to solve the issues related to non-fungible products in the supply chain. Choice over the selected case study was made in light of the divergence in motives for the adoption of blockchain (economic over social), which makes the results more inferable at a broader scale and offers an insight into how sustainable innovations can also be economically viable."

We think so, and online sales of luxury goods could triple to €70 billion by 2025. October 2015 | by Marco Catena, Nathalie Remy, and Benjamin Durand-Servoingt How might luxury e-commerce develop over the next five to ten years? As part of our annual Altagamma-McKinsey Digital Luxury Experience Observatory1 we analyzed the online-sales trajectories of more than 50 luxury brands over the past decade. What we found is that the market’s sales trajectory resembles an S-curve that can be disaggregated into three steps: Exhibit Enlarge Ramp-up. Luxury players investigate selling online either through partners with full-price, off-price, or events platforms or through their own e-shop. At this point, they tend to only offer a reduced product range and not advertise it much. Scale-up. Once they begin to have sizeable revenue coming from e-commerce—around 6 to 7 percent of total sales—luxury players reach a tipping point where they quickly scale their e-commerce operations and launch full e-shops. Many in the industry are now in this phase: they feature the majority of their products online, and they have upgraded their websites while increasing online and offline visibility. E-commerce now becomes a top management priority because of the significant investments required in IT, customer support, and the supply chain (for example, warehousing) and because it will in turn drive online sales toward 18 to 20 percent of total revenue in the next five years. Plateau. After passing the 20-percent threshold, growth of online sales tends to decelerate as a brand’s e-commerce operations reach maturity. Taking into account the sector’s experience and our extensive knowledge of other industries that are more mature in their digital development, such as mass fashion and consumer electronics, we forecast that the global luxury e-commerce market will follow a trajectory similar to individual brands. We expect luxury’s share of online sales to double from 6 to 12 percent by 2020. By 2025, we expect the online share of total luxury sales to be 18 percent, worth about €70 billion annually, making e-commerce the world’s third largest luxury market, after China and the United States.

Product life cycles are getting shorter. Production has to be faster and increasingly local. The acceleration of “time-to-market” could happen thanks to the solutions of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with supply chains morphing into highly adaptive networks with integrated entities. In this paper, we seek to exemplify the potential impact of I4.0 adoption on the competitiveness of the firms (being foreign subsidiaries among others) and ask about the nature of modernization as part of the global value chain in which the enterprise operates. Our research based on four case studies reveals that the competitive advantage of a firm could be modified in the era of Industry 4.0 as a result of a sector’s transformation and changing relationships with partners. These findings correspond with the literature stressing the uncertainty and complexity of the digital economy in general, as well as difficulties with the precise measuring of the expected benefits. The fourth industrial revolution emphasizes “the race to the top” giving priority to quality rather than cost reduction as a method of improving competitiveness and, since it implies the emergence of connected companies, truly linked with each other, the disappearance of clear boundaries between them."

In modern manufacturing equipment, standard interfaces such as MTConnect and Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture facilitate the data acquisition process by providing a means of easily capturing machine controller data. With data from these interfaces, monitoring quantities such as machine utilization are possible by monitoring the MTConnect interface and performing analysis on the machine state. In a distributed manufacturing environment, a means of remotely accessing this data must be developed. The infrastructure responsible for this data transmission must be secure, scalable, and standardized. If detailed machine health metrics are to be analyzed, the infrastructure should be able to accommodate data from sources beyond the machine controller itself. Supplementing the controller data with that from additional sensors, such as accelerometers, temperature, humidity, and current sensors, a more complete picture of machine health status can be created.

Platform owners have property rights, enabling them to establish a boundary of permissible innovation demarcating the permitted from the prohibited. This allows for the curation of complements, which provides a means of controlling for value creation. Consequently, platform innovationthe innovation of platform complements is occasionally refused by platform owners. When this occurs tensions may arise between the two parties over where the boundary of permissible innovation should lie. Tussles may break out, embodied in complex interactions, as each party attempts to get its way. Eventually an outcome is achieved, and a platform innovation is either allowed or prohibited. A body of platform innovation literature is emerging from fields including information systems. Whilst this literature considers many aspects of platform innovation, the dynamics concerning the control of the innovation of platform innovation complements is overlooked. This research attempts to address that gap. Its relevance to information systems concerns the digitalisation of platforms as systemsdigital infrastructures, which affects their capacity for innovation and regulation. This research uses the method of narrative networks to analyse 45 examples of contested platform innovation. This approach, informed by empirical data sourced from over 4500 blog entries, identifies patterned sequences of actions across the examples. These sequences describe how tension builds, how control is asserted, and how control is then resisted. A theory of formal managerial control is used to explain how mechanisms of control are applied by platform owners as well as how developers respond to control. The principle contribution of this research is to theory. It develops and presents a theory to describe and explain the dynamics of contested innovation of complements on curated digital platforms. In doing so, iIt challenges the understanding that the platform owner alone controls platform design rules and concerning which platform complements are allowed, and which are notthe boundary of permissible innovation. Furthermore, tThe study indicates opens up the possibility that the forces of digitalisation provide third parties with the power to affect influence platform architecture, but at the cost of additional means of being controlled."

Some of the economics of the dispersed vision are explored, and perspectives are presented on both the choice of homogeneous universal power quality upstream in the electricity supply chain and on the extremely heterogeneous requirements of end-use loads. It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid. Finally, the potential role of microgrids in delivering heterogeneous power quality is demonstrated by reference to two ongoing microgrid tests in the U.S. and Japan."

ABSTRACT Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are becoming increasingly dependent on alternative ways to finance their working capital, as their trading counterparts are extending payment terms, and increased capital requirements are forced upon banks, limiting access to traditional sources of funding. At the same time, financing SMEs is not trivial: (1) traditional supply-chain finance is not scalable to achieve mass adoption and (2) factoring involves risk assessment on the basis of historical data, leading to a certain minimum financing value. Innovative non-bank players are also addressing this market with new platforms with state of the art technology, but encounter the same limitations. With the advance of digital invoicing , payment and risk techniques, new methods for financing SMEs are becoming possible. The paradigm described here consists of creating a collaborative network in which payment status information on payable invoices is being exchanged in real-time and on request from the creditor SME or its lender. Real-time Financing (RTF) makes it easier for SMEs to"

In reviewing the trends and technologies the discussion focuses on how significant they are to the global economy, developments over the last 40 years, current issues and predictions for the next 20 years and beyond. The Technological trends include Automation, Digital integration, Electronics and Communications, Materials, Modelling and Simulation, Rapid Changeability, Rise of the Web and Raw Materials. The key economic trend which is thought likely to affect manufacturing is Global supply chain management whereas the key sociological trend is individualisation and personalisation as customers demand products that are specifically designed for them. There is also the key environmental trend of sustainability as the population becomes ever more concerned with the world around it. Many of the trends appear to be converging around IT and the Web/Internet which are quickly becoming the basis for most manufacturing. The report covers a total of 16 technologies ranging from Additive Manufacturing to Virtual Product Creation. The UK is very strong in many of these technologies and in a good position to exploit them in manufacturing. The UK has a strong reputation for design innovation. If this could be better linked to the areas of Additive Manufacturing, advanced design methodologies and tools and advanced supply chain management then there will be many opportunities for new products and manufacturing facilities located in the UK. One of the recurring themes with many of the technologies in this report is a concern over the perceived lack of skills base in the UK to fully exploit the opportunities. Connected with most of the technologies the skills shortages range from craft and technician level to Doctorate. There may be some benefit from a government department studying each technology to determine how the skill demands will be met at all levels. There then needs to be a clear plan to meet these demands. There could also be a benefit from rethinking the way technologies move through the technology readiness levels from basic research to product launch."

Abstract Purpose – The authors examine the role of entrepreneurial business models in the reverse supply chain of apparel/fashion retailers. The purpose of this paper is to offer an alternative approach to the "" return to the point of origin "" prevalent in the reverse chain of manufacturers but less technically and economically feasible in the case of apparel/fashion retailers. This approach, second-life retailing, not only reduces waste but also democratises consumption. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an extensive literature review, semi-structured interviews with managers of two second-life retailers in Malaysia and observations of a number of stores. Findings – Using the Business Model Canvas, the authors demonstrate the essential characteristics of second-life retailers. Retailers in this study, unlike retailers in the developed world, combine traditional business models with off-price retailing. There is no clear demarcation between the forward and reverse supply chain used to manage first-and second-hand retailing. Practical implications – The paper demonstrates the potential of innovative business models in the reverse supply chain. It encourages managers to look beyond the "" return to the point of origin "" and seek imaginative alternatives. Such alternatives potentially could result in additional revenue, enhanced sustainability and democratisation of consumption meeting triple bottom line objectives. Originality/value – This paper highlights the importance and relevance of entrepreneurial business models in addressing the reverse supply chain, demonstrating this with the aid of two Malaysian off-price retailers. It also contributes to our nascent knowledge by focusing on emerging markets."

A novel high-resolution (2–4 m source and receiver spacing) reflection and refraction seismic survey was carried out for aquifer characterization and to confirm the existing depositional model of the interlobate esker of Virttaankangas, which is part of the Säkylänharju-Virttaankangas glaciofluvial esker-chain complex in southwest Finland. The interlobate esker complex hosting the managed aquifer recharge (MAR) plant is the source of the entire water supply for the city of Turku and its surrounding municipalities. An accurate delineation of the aquifer is therefore critical for long-term MAR planning and sustainable use of the esker resources. Moreover, an additional target was to resolve the poorly known stratigraphy of the 70–100-m-thick glacial deposits overlying a zone of fractured bedrock. Bedrock surface as well as fracture zones were confirmed through combined reflection seismic and refraction tomography results and further validated against existing borehole information. The high-resolution seismic data proved successful in accurately delineating the esker cores and revealing complex stratigraphy from fan lobes to kettle holes, providing valuable information for potential new pumping wells. This study illustrates the potential of geophysical methods for fast and cost-effective esker studies, in particular the digital-based landstreamer and its combination with geophone-based wireless recorders, where the cover sediments are reasonably thick."

Likely applications in the field of medicine could include electronic health records, health insurance, biomedical research, drug supply and procurement processes, and medical education. Utilization of blockchain is not without its weaknesses and currently, this technology is extremely immature and lacks public or even expert knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts, and user adoption.

These counterfeit chips may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturer. Therefore, developing effective countermeasures against such malpractices is becoming severely crucial. Physical unclonable function (PUF)-based authentication methods have the potential to mitigate these challenges. However, PUF-based solutions are restrained by several factors, such as additional design efforts and significant area/power overhead, struggle to maintain and update challenge-response pairs (CRPs) database, and the vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In this article, we address these challenges by developing a novel database-free and enrolment-free hardware authentication approaches, i.e., a digital watermark metric for ICs. To enable efficient database-free hardware integrity verification without enrolment, first, we transform the intrinsic variations in circuit parameters, e.g., boundary scan chain (BSC) path delays in the joint test action group (JTAG) chain into robust digital signatures. Then, we perform statistical analysis on a small pilot unit of authentic chips to create a robust watermark for a complete batch of chips, which jointly captures the characteristics of the physical layout, the manufacturing process, and the foundry. The increasing complexity in the current state-of-the-art designs makes it extremely hard for an adversary to perfectly clone such statistical characterization of circuit parameters using counterfeit or compromised hardware. Besides, the proposed approach requires no additional design or hardware overhead in IC design since it utilizes an embedded structure, which inherently exists within the chips. It also obviates the design house from characterizing each manufactured chip instance, reducing overall testing cost. A path-delay measurement method at a high resolution based on clock phase sweep is introduced to measure the delay values effectively. The proposed intrinsic identifier-based authentication approach is validated by performing emulation on FPGAs and also by conducting physical measurements on custom-made printed circuit boards (PCBs). The reliability of the generated watermarks is evaluated with environmental temperature fluctuations and the aging effect."

Fundamentally, blockchain is a distributed ledger of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. That information is stored chronologically, can be viewed by a community of users, but is decentralised and is not usually managed by a central authority such as a bank or a government, and once published, the information on the blockchain cannot be changed. Make no mistake, blockchain has arrived, offering immense opportunity for industry to become more effective, transparent, productive and sustainable. But what is it, and how do businesses, engineers and built environment professionals even begin to think about how they could capitalise upon this potential? That is where this report steps in to offer some clarity, direction and signal the opportunity presented by blockchain technology in construction. This includes smart contracts; payment and project management; procurement and supply chain management; BIM and smart asset management; and the challenges ahead for implementation. ICE’s Professional Skills (2018) report recognised the opportunities and challenges that continue to be presented by the introduction of digital technology and the profound effect that it will have on the work of civil engineers in the coming years, in both the construction and operation of infrastructure assets.

This has (had) huge ramifications for all areas of documentary making, none more so than on the issue of documentary ethics. Above all other forms of film (and filmmaking), ethics is one of the key factors that define and distinguish the documentary film. However, much of the ethical frameworks and discourse currently used are from the previous analogue period of distribution and exhibition. Using the making of a feature documentary as a case study, this article explores how the changes in exhibition and distribution have affected the ethical frameworks that have traditionally informed the making of a documentary.

Due to the combined influence of these aspects, music production-consumption acquires some unique features. Added to that, the swift evolution and growing influence of the economic-technological association have increasingly affected music as a sociocultural phenomenon, as an art form, and as a corporate business, increasing the complexity of an already convoluted context. Given the composite and dynamic constitution of the music field, the present approach departs from an interdisciplinary analysis, establishing a methodological groundwork that comprehends conceptual and qualitative research, elaborated through exploratory study. Under a standard economic perspective, music production-consumption belongs in the structure of the music supply chain, presenting a rather uncertain status between service and good. Apart from the economic understanding, however, music comprises a wide variety of manifestations, which do not suit conventional production-consumption processes. In order to cope with the inexorable duality of this paradoxical coexistence, this study proposes a model intended to contribute to the building of a comprehensive knowledge on music production and consumption. As this model departs from some specific flows of music production and consumption, it creates an array of patterns, pinpointing their situation within the service-good spectrum. In addition, it considers Digital Revolution and globalised communications as enablers that affect the foundations of traditional music, unbalance routine flows inside the supply chain of the music industry, and cause music production-consumption relationships to shift their status from good-oriented to service-oriented."

Abstract Purpose – The paper reports a comprehensive review of supply chain performance measurement systems and raises a set of research issues leading to selected research questions. Design/methodology/approach – The articles which have been published in selected peer-reviewed international journals in the last ten years were collected by using databases Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge. The articles were scrutinized based on authors' perspective analysis (using supply chain measures and metrics, and enhancing supply chain performance as the key perspectives). The articles contributing significantly in the domain of supply chain measures and metrics were selected for final review and various issues were identified. Findings – The paper argues that, despite considerable evidence from the literature in supply chain performance measurement in recent years, there is a large scope for research to address the issues in supply chain performance measurement, including: characteristics of measures and metrics, benchmarking of measures, use of management practices, integration and partnership and socio-environmental relevance.

By creating a circular economy value chain, automotive players gain efficiency, increase profitability and improve customer loyalty. The circular economy breaks the old linear patterns of "" take, make, waste, "" and reimagines the concept of waste in every link of the value chain—from car design to car decline. The industry's most recent circular engagement is in car and ride sharing, which many incumbent OEMs now offer along with traditional vehicle sales. The result: Upwards of three to five times higher usage rates and a massive jump in resource and asset efficiency. Turning wasted capacity into a new revenue source for established OEMs and new entrants alike. With lean manufacturing many carmakers have made great strides in recycling as well. But a broader view of waste reveals much more potential still to be mined from the circular economy. Along with sharing and recycling, further approaches from product as a service, product life extension and circular supply chain (see "" Circular showroom "") are set to transform the automotive industry's business models. Moving OEMs, in particular, out of the low-margin manufacturing end of the automotive game. By going the extra mile, and creating a circular economy value chain, automotive companies not only gain efficiency in their supply chains, they increase profitability and improve customer loyalty. Making these approaches possible are technological advances in areas like machine-to-machine communication, analytics, artificial intelligence and modular design. Thanks to advances in digital technology, the time is right—right now—to harness the power of the circular economy."

Traditional retailers and their suppliers constitute a significant portion of developing countries' payment flows and yet have limited access to financial and payment services. They also sit at the crossroads of the cash economy, conducting a large volume of repeat transactions with suppliers as well as unbanked consumers. While incentives for end consumers to pay retailers electronically instead of in cash remain weak, suppliers to these retailers are better equipped and under more pressure to transition to electronic payments. Suppliers' incentives can be harnessed to expand adoption of digital payments. Electronic payments can bring greater value to retailers and their suppliers if they are integrated with solutions that unlock gains in operations, sales and inventory finance. Because suppliers are generally already banked, only one party to the transaction, the retailer, needs to be persuaded to transition away from cash. If retailers pay suppliers electronically, their own incentive to accept electronic value, instead of cash, from consumers increases. This can help to reach the tipping point at which the switch from cash to electronic begins to be pushed not just for remote but also face-to-face transactions. Non-bank payments and supply chain services for this segment of the economy can help to unlock these economies of scale. Operational and business links between new payment networks and banking services can be mutually beneficial. Mobile and e-money providers have advantages in reaching small retailers, some of which act as agents. Meanwhile banks and supply chain integrators reach suppliers and distributors serving these retailers. Policy makers should encourage these actors to align to serve the needs of the retail industry in a manner that will boost overall payment service uptake and usage. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Some of the economics of the dispersed vision are explored, and perspectives are presented on both the choice of homogeneous universal power quality upstream in the electricity supply chain and on the extremely heterogeneous requirements of end-use loads. It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid. Finally, the potential role of microgrids in delivering heterogeneous power quality is demonstrated by reference to two ongoing microgrid tests in the U.S. and Japan."

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute a major portion of the German economy, accounting for a large proportion of country’s businesses and total employment. According to the most recent estimates, the SME sector, including services, 99.8% of the total number of enterprises, 76.7% of total employment, 38% of capital investment, 25% of value added, roughly 10% of exports and 5% of bank credit. Therefore, while SMEs dominate the economy in terms of employment, they evidently operate with comparatively little capital equipment, generate relatively low levels of value added, make only a small contribution to German exports. In order to change that situation Industry 4.0 is seen a favorable opportunity by authorities to increase value-added services and share of made German exports. Because Industry 4.0 reduces non-value-added data manipulation, improves OEM/SME based supply chain communications, enhances SME supply chain business performance, addresses interoperability concerns across both technical and business domains of the digital enterprise, opens new manufacturing technological career opportunities and integrates the human in the digital world to enhance decision making. Other opportunities for SMEs include Combined Augmented Reality and Modeling and Simulation can reduce errors that drive operational costs when physically implemented, use of Cloud Based tools and computing will enhance business and technical data analysis and decision making, IoT will provide for not only factory data to be integrated but also data from fielded products, robots interacting to perform repeatable complex tasks and improve output quality and cross domain and functional integration will greatly improve communications. Within relation to this; paper mainly includes 4 sections. It starts with the introduction and in that part Industry 4.0 and SMEs structure in Germany is broadly defined. In section 2, theoretical roots in other words literature review on the subject will be presented. Causal effects of challenges related to Industry 4.0 will be explained and related problems et cetera will be discussed in detail. In section 3, after explaining the Industry 4.0, insight will be brought up for discussion like what its economic potential is and will Industry 4.0 will be a massacre of employment in future or it is only exaggeration? After that special focus will be given to Germany and the situation in Germany will be explained in terms of Industry 4.0’s effects on SMEs. Section 4 will include conclusion. Besides giving insight about Industry 4.0 for comparison purposes between different purposes, the purpose of this paper is to provide information for the potential researchers about basic effects of Industry 4.0."

Observed changes in rockglacier motion on seasonal to decadal timescales have been linked to ground temperature variations and related changes in landform geometries interpreted as signs of degradation due to climate warming. Despite the extensive kinematic and thermal monitoring of these creeping permafrost landforms, our understanding of the controlling factors remains limited and lacks robust quantitative models for rockglacier evolution in relation to their environmental setting. Here, we use a holistic approach to analyze the current and long-term dynamical development of two rockglaciers in the Swiss Alps. Site-specific sedimentation and ice generation rates are linked with an adapted numerical flow model for rockglaciers that couples the process chain from material deposition to rockglacier flow in order to reproduce observed rockglacier geometries and their general dynamics. Modelling experiments exploring the impact of variations in rockglacier temperature and sediment/ice supply show that these forcing processes are not sufficient for explaining the currently observed short-term geometrical changes derived from multitemporal digital terrain models at the two different rockglacier. The modelling also shows that rockglacier thickness is dominantly controlled by slope and rheology while the advance rates are mostly constrained by rates of sediment/ice supply. Furthermore, timescales of dynamical adjustment are found to be strongly linked to creep velocity. Overall, we provide a useful modelling framework for a better understanding of the dynamical response and morphological changes of rockglaciers to changes in external forcing."

Design Perspective. Methods Data for this perspective were obtained from several sources. Literature reviews for compounding-related endophthalmitis and drug counterfeiting were performed. Supplemental information was obtained through targeted Google searches for related published manuscripts. First-hand accounts of negotiations between representatives of the Vitreoretinal Society of India (VRSI) and India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) were provided by 2 of the authors (R.N., V.G.). Results In December, 2015, 15 cases of intraocular inflammation following injections of counterfeit bevacizumab occurred in Gujarat, India. CDSCO reacted by prohibiting the use of intraocular bevacizumab throughout the country. Intense negotiations between the VRSI and CDSCO resulted in the permission to use bevacizumab in accordance with new safety guidelines. These include an enhanced informed consent process, the stamping of the Kezzler code on all bevacizumab vials, a real-time digital verification process between the end user and Roche Pharmaceuticals, and mandatory destruction of empty drug vials. Conclusion Counterfeit bevacizumab has caused outbreaks of sterile and infectious postinjection endophthalmitis in at least 3 countries during the past 5 years and has entered the supply chain in other countries. Physicians and compounding pharmacists need to be aware that international counterfeiters have targeted bevacizumab."

Sydney (2017) (May) 61,false,"[""Staples M"",""Chen S"",""Falamaki S"",""et al.See more""]",[],"Blockchain technologies originally emerged to support new forms of digital currency, but now hold promise as a new foundation for transactions in society. A blockchain is both a database recording transactions between parties, and also a computational platform to execute small programs (called ‘smart contracts’) as transactions. A blockchain is a distributed database, replicated across many locations and operated jointly by a collective. Blockchains transactions can support services for payments, escrow, notarisation, voting, registration, and process coordination. These are key in the operation of government and industry. Conventionally, these services are provided by specific trusted third-parties such as banks, legal firms, accountancy firms, government agencies, and service providers in specific industries. With a blockchain-based system, rather than relying on third-party organisations, we could instead choose to rely on the blockchain software and on a majority of the collective that jointly operates the blockchain system. The report describes some of the technical risks and opportunities in the application of blockchain technologies within government and industry, and how to assess whether blockchain-based systems will meet critical requirements. The project explores this primarily through the description and analysis of high-level design alternatives for illustrative ‘use cases’. Three use cases have been selected after a number of initial workshops and preliminary research: remittance payments, open data registries, and agricultural supply chain. These provide reasonable coverage of various kinds of requirements and regulatory concerns, against which we can evaluate design alternatives, and in turn learn more general lessons about blockchain technologies. In addition to this design-based analysis, we also report on some empirical results from testing prototype implementations. Compared to conventional centralised databases and computational platforms (on-premises or cloud), blockchains can reduce some counter-party and operational risks by providing neutral ground between organisations. Blockchain technologies may provide advantages for integrity and non-repudiation. However, they also currently have limitations for confidentiality, privacy, and scalability. For latency and availability, reading is improved but writing is worsened. Blockchains are also subject to a different cost model. Digital currency transfer and long-term storage of transactional data may be less expensive. However, program execution and storage of big data may be more expensive. Public blockchains provide very low barriers to entry for new participants, which can facilitate competition, innovation, and productivity. However, they do not mandate authentication of those participants, which creates challenges for regulation of money laundering, terrorism financing, and tax avoidance. Private blockchains can impose more controls on authentication and access, which can partly address those regulatory concerns. Still, for competitors within an industry consortium, private blockchains may not be private enough to provide normal levels of commercial confidentiality for business operations, competitive position, and customer relationships. When assessing business risk, regulatory acceptance, and assurance arguments for a blockchain-based system, we need to consider not just the blockchain, but also all of the other components that are integrated in the design of the whole system. Other components will provide user interfaces, cryptographic key management, and off-chain databases, communications, and processing. Judicious use of these other components may mitigate blockchain’s risks while still leveraging blockchain’s opportunities. Finally, blockchains are still a rapidly evolving technology, with ongoing developments especially to improve scalability and confidentiality. Globally, governments, enterprises, and startups are exploring the technology/ market fit in a wide variety of use cases and for a wide variety of requirements and regulatory demands. There is still much that is unknown about the development of trustworthy blockchain-based systems. Further research is required to improve our knowledge about how to create blockchain-based systems that work, and how to create evidence that blockchain-based systems will work as required."

A transient study shows that the tunneling current has a negligible contribution in charging and discharging the gate capacitance of TFETs. In spite of a higher resistance region in the short-gate TFET, the gate (dis)charging speed still meets low-voltage application requirements. A circuit analysis is performed on short-gate TFETs with different materials, such as Si, Ge and heterostructures in terms of voltage overshoot, delay, static power, energy consumption and energy delay product (EDP). These results are compared to MOSFET and full-gate TFET performance. It is concluded that short-gate heterostructure TFETs (Ge-source for nTFET, In0.6Ga0.4As-source for pTFET) are promising candidates to extend the supply voltage to lower than 0.5 V because they combine the advantage of a low Miller capacitance, due to the short-gate structures, and strong drive current in TFETs, due to the narrow bandgap material in the source. At a supply voltage of 0.4 V and for an EOT and channel length of 0.6 nm and 40 nm, respectively, a three-stage inverter chain based on short-gate heterostructure TFETs saves 40% energy consumption per cycle at the same delay and shows 60%-75% improvement of EDP at the same static power, compared to its full-gate counterpart. When compared to the MOSFET, better EDP can be achieved in the heterostructure TFET especially at low static power consumption. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd."

This therefore meant that the CSD was to ensure that all registered suppliers have an equal and fair prospect of providing goods and services to government, and that acquiring of goods and services is done in a cost-effective manner. However, the Limpopo provincial departments are persistently underspending their allocated budgets at the end of each financial year.Aim: The aim of this study was to assess whether CSD as an electronic procurement (e-procurement) system adopted by the provincial departments in Limpopo is efficient and cost-effective in enhancing the provisioning of goods and services.Setting: The study focused on the Limpopo provincial departments, South Africa.Methods: The study used a qualitative research approach to assess the use of CSD in enabling e-procurement processes. Purposive sampling was employed to sample 14 participants from 12 provincial departments.Results: The outcome revealed that the technological innovation of centralising the suppliers’ records on the CSD increased transparency and accountability in the process of selecting suppliers who qualify to do business with government, and the system has the potential, if rightly used, to eliminate corrupt activities such as favouritism and collusion.Conclusion: The article concludes that the successful implementation of CSD by provincial departments and public entities may, amongst other things, improve supply chain management performance, particularly in the selection of suppliers, and may also promote economic development of small, medium and micro-enterprises."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this article is to investigate the nature of the humanitarian aid supply chain and discuss the extent to which certain business supply chain concepts, particularly supply chain agility, are relevant to humanitarian aid. Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies elements of good practice in conventional business supply chains and applies them to the humanitarian aid supply chain, making use of published practice-based literature and web sites associated with humanitarian aid. Particular emphasis is placed on the concept of "" agility "" in supply chain management. A model of an agile supply chain for humanitarian aid is developed. Findings – Humanitarian supply chains have similarities with business supply chains, but there are significant differences. Many humanitarian supply chains have a short and unstable existence with an inadequate link between emergency aid and longer-term developmental aid. Unlike many business supply chains, typical emergency aid appeals assign inventory to a particular destination at the supply chain source. Practical implications – This research note is a starting-point for empirical studies to test the agile humanitarian supply chain model. Originality/value – This paper seeks to integrate humanitarian aid practice with concepts in the academic supply chain literature. In particular, proposes that humanitarian donors need convincing of the value of supply chain processes."

It was March 2018, and he was visiting the port to check in on the status of a new project. White took in the chaotic scene around him. Large cranes hurriedly unloaded shipping containers off of massive cargo ships. The containers were packed to the brim with all kinds of goods, everything from flowers to flat-screen TVs. Customs authorities shuffled through thick stacks of papers as they inspected the incoming cargo. White noticed a long line of trucks idling at the port's entrance waiting to haul the goods to destinations across Europe. At the far end of the port, tugboats towed the Madison Maersk into the terminal. The vessel was one of the biggest container ships in the world. The ship was longer than three football fields and capable of hauling more than 18,000 standard shipping containers, the equivalent of 1,200 Boeing 747s (see Exhibit 1). 1 Watching the flurry of activity reminded White of the litany of problems in global trade. The industry was rife with inefficient paper-based processes. Companies had little visibility into the status of goods as they moved through the supply chain. Communication between firms was often complicated and expensive. The administrative costs involved with transporting a shipping container were shockingly high. Maersk was the largest container shipping company in the world. The company's senior management had selected White to run a new project they hoped would address the difficulties in the industry. Maersk had partnered with IBM on a new global trade digitization platform that was intended to act a utility for the industry and lower the barriers to trade. Blockchain, a technology associated primarily with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, would power part of the platform. The team at Maersk felt that blockchain could help deliver clarity to an often confusing supply chain. Blockchain would act as a distributed ledger, giving all the players in global trade access to a single source of truth. Maersk and IBM decided to launch this new platform as part of an independent joint venture. Once regulatory approvals went through in a few months, White would become the new CEO of the firm. He wondered if the joint venture was the right organization to operate this new blockchain platform for global trade. What challenges would White face along the way?"

Such a money exchange transaction is called peer-to-peer transaction. When it comes to digital world, money exchange between two on-line entities is always monitored by a trusted third party like bank. The cryptographic research community constantly asked for over two decades the question: “can the concept of peer-to-peer transactions be introduced into the digital world?” The landmark proposal of Bitcoin crypto-currency (Nakamoto, 2009) provides a perfect answer to the question. However, Bitcoin suffers from criticism from many, given its uncontrollable nature. Despite this setback, what has caught more attention of the community is its underlying technology: Blockchain. The blockchain technology is touted to be the next big wave in industry as it promises the features: transparency of data, accountability of transactions, transactions without intermediary, and data symmetry. The banking sector and supply chain systems are two fields that benefit most from this new technology and will witness a dramatic transformation. In addition to these two fields, blockchain has potential to show its implications to water management, health analytics, and several other areas. However, from a development point of view, the technology is still in rudimentary stage. It demands expertise in the subjects: distributed networking and cryptography. The features promised by the technology seek a new type of cryptographic algorithms, which are sort of open issues to be resolved. These open issues form the current active research of the cryptographic community. The main focus of the present chapter is to teach the fundamentals of the blockchain technology and its use cases. The use cases are discussed through the blockchain platforms: Hyperledger, Ethereum, and other upcoming platforms. The chapter discusses the open research problems that are to be solved in having a full-fledged blockchain environment."

Collectively, these networks create significant patient safety risks, including acting as unregulated access points encouraging prescription drug abuse. Although law enforcement is active in combating this form of cybercrime, there are several difficulties in prosecuting individuals involved in online prescription drug distribution. We characterize these challenges by conducting a comprehensive legal review and analysis of USA civil and criminal cases associated with online pharmacies. This is accomplished by reviewing legal documents/filings available via the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) database, the Drug Enforcement Agency's website, and structured search queries using the Google search engine. We found more than 100 cases, including criminal indictments, sentencing documents, judgments, forfeiture orders, motions, civil complaints, and restitution documents. Our review indicates that current legal tools and regulatory policies do not effectively deter this highly profitable criminal activity. Hence, we issue a “Call to Action,” advocating the need for more robust legal remedies and criminal penalties, and greater legal and policy coherence at the domestic, regional, and global level aimed at improving patient safety and ensuring the integrity of the drug supply chain."

Findings: The work illustrates that BDO enhances manufacturing workflow, reduces product manufacturing lead time and augments quality assurance throughout the whole life cycle of a manufactured product. The conceptual model developed provides a pragmatic and comprehensive solution to automate construction manufacturing procedures and to improve the facilitation of information exchanged between all stakeholders involved. Originality/value: This study presents the first comprehensive case study of BDO application within a manufacturing context. Future research is however, needed to test and validate the conceptual model presented in practice. In doing so, the model can be further refined using practitioner input and real-life manufacturing processes and procedures."

The study is based on information available on the internet as of May 15, 2019. Blockchain, a digital ledger technology (DLT), gained notoriety with its first successful application, the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The 2009 launch of bitcoin led to a proliferation of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Organizations around the world discovered that various forms of blockchains can be used to facilitate business processes and improve record-keeping. Industry giants, such as IBM, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as major accounting and consulting firms are investing heavily in business applications of the technology. Blockchain promises greater effectiveness and efficiency for governmental entities. Many cities, counties, states and federal agencies are at least exploring its use to determine whether the technology can provide these improvements along with more accountability and/or transparency. As shown in Figure 1, a report published by IDC Government Insights predicts spending on blockchain will increase approximately 1,000% by 2022 over 2017 levels among federal and state-and-local governments in the United States.1 Early spending is expected to focus on supply chain and asset management before progressing to more identity management and complex financial transactions."

Abstract Purpose – In response to increasing demands on improved environmental performance, companies need to develop their capabilities in assessing the environmental performance of their operations. Knowledge among practitioners as well as solid research results in this area is lacking. This paper aims to present a framework of dimensions, which are important to consider regarding environmental measurement in supply chain management. The paper also aims to present a practical example on how environmental performance measurements can be a success by applying these dimensions. Design/methodology/approach – Literature regarding logistics management and performance measurement is coupled with theories regarding environmental logistics and green supply chain management. A framework is developed. A case study based on four actors in a reverse supply chain is used to illustrate the framework. Findings – The paper outlines important aspects to consider in the design of environmental performance measurements in supply chain management and identifies shortcomings in existing research. The case presents successful examples of how environmental performance measurements can be applied across managerial levels as well as company borders in a supply chain. Practical implications – The literature review shows shortcomings in the measuring tools applied today. The case provides examples of how these shortcomings can be addressed. Originality/value – This paper addresses the intersection between environmental logistics and performance measurements. The case shows how environmental performance measurements can be applied over a single company's borders by including four different actors in the supply chain."

Surprisingly, MC is still confused with mass produced ready-to-wear fashion (Fiore, Lee, & Kunz, 2004). MC is a production strategy to generate individual uniqueness at low cost, where globalization and technological improvements, has made the fashion industry even more competitive (De Raeve, Cools, De Smedt, & Bossaer, 2012). In our contemporary fashion retail world with an expanding supply from omni-channel retailers and e-tailers, the market for fashion has become overwhelming, and might become a serious threat to sustainability if the industry keeps on producing to an overheated market (Claudio, 2007). With an overflow of fashion products, retail strategies are changing, embracing motivational drivers such as individualization of shopping in terms of services, often illustrated as curated retailing[1] (Sebald & Jacob, 2018). This phenomenon could be seen as mass customization of services, where retailers are trying to tailor both online and offline shopping experience to every unique customer with the help of personal shoppers and/or advices, combined with individual offerings and campaigns (price, delivery costs, brands, and customer happenings). But where can we identify true MC with promising ideas, contributing to a more sustainable fashion industry? Today, individualized offering in terms of garment’s style, fit and color can be found on many online mass customization stores, with limited reach to physical stores mainly because e-channel makes information collection and order processing faster and easier (Li, Huang, Cheng, & Ji, 2015). For instance, the Swedish online retailer Tailor Store AB, started offering mass-customized shirts for men in the year 2003 (“Tailor Store: One Size Only – Yours. Skräddarsydda skjortor.,” n.d.). This online fashion retailer has an interactive online product configurator that allows the customer to tailor the shirt according to individual needs and wants. People can change the style, fabric and fit by interacting with their online product configurator. However, a configurator like that increases the complexity of production processes (Mukherjee, 2017) and affects the objective of low costs. Many operations still require manual work like adapting the standard size pattern to the newly obtained measurements, adjusting the production plan, as every garment is unique in some way. This becomes a hindrance to achieve cost-efficiency and hence is an unresolved issue from the industry point of view (Zancul, Durao, Rocha, & Silva, 2016). Due to the need of manual work described above, the so called mass customization can’t really be seen as “mass” produced. In addition, another company called Unmade (“Home | Unmade,” n.d.), realized a business opportunity in this regard. It introduced an online platform that connects the customer and manufacturer by transforming customer needs into production ready information. With this platform they combined the roles of various supply chain actors to provide a common solution for several participators. It can be inferred from the above instance that every actor in the fashion supply chain holds a certain type of end-user data. It is not certain, however, that there is an effective mechanism of information sharing within the fashion chain, even if many agrees upon the promising future for MC. MC requires an integrated supply chain to facilitate seamless information flow. This can provide additional data that can be utilized for designing an efficient MC Service and in turn enhancing customer experience (Grieco et al., 2017). Purpose & Research Question Currently, the major reason for disintegration in the MC supply chain is due to competition. Because of which the manufacturer offer standardized garments through retailers and customized garments through their online channel (Li et al., 2015). We believe that the fashion industry is ready to seek j int ventures among its various actors to innovate the processes that can facilitate mass customization. There is a need for the actors to recognize the value of data they possess for the development of the fashion industry as a whole. In this regard, the aim of this paper is to address the following research question: What kind of data is available in the fashion supply chain and what are the barriers that restrict various actors to share this data and work together to cater to the mass customization business model? Design/methodology/approach We plan to present a Swedish case study based on interviews with various stakeholders (fashion designers, textile designers, fabric manufacturers, garment manufacturers, merchandisers, logistics & operations manager, and retailer) in the supply chain of a mass customization company. Findings We hope to present a case indicating that the promising idea with mass customization does not have to mean the downfall of the retail stores. In fact, the phenomenon should provide retailers with an opportunity to make use of the upcoming digital technologies, internet of things (IoT) and big data analytics for providing high-value services and unique experiences that drive the customers to the stores. Our ambition is to identify opportunities with data sharing and joint ventures with the common goal of designing a customer-centric supply chain that offers a completely customized purchasing experience, truly transforming the fashion retail industry. Preliminary findings from projects performed by one of the authors, supports the idea that data in the fashion supply chain is crucial in understanding customer behavior and knowing their preferences. Handling this big data smartly can give answers to umpteen questions related to but not restricted to most promising customer attribution channels and technologies (Shao & Li, n.d.). This data cannot only help in personalization but also target offers at point of sale and other touchpoints (any point of interaction with the customers), blending their offline and online presence (Meyer & Schwager, 2007). The most common type of data collected by the retailers is the customer’s purchase history, which does not help to comprehend each customer’s interests and preferences. The data collected by the retailers is of utmost importance as it is collected directly from the customer. However, the type of data that the retailers are gathering is not sufficient. According to a Forrester study, over 60% of the customers are willing to provide information directly to the retailers by filling short surveys or questionnaires. However, only 39% retailers are actually practicing this. In addition, the kind of information asked is not the ones customer actually would like to share (Murray & Consulting, 2017). The end aim should be an on-demand supply chain where it’s not just customization. Customization requires active participation from all the actors in the supply chain, so it is also the ability to re-stock the shops more efficiently and respond to trends quicker.

However, high investment cost and inadequate technical capability remain as challenges for RFID system implementations. That being the case, fair evaluation of savings associated with increasing performance and investment costs has a great role in the success of RFID projects. RFID is an Automatic Identification (Auto-ID) system consisting of a microchip with a coiled antenna (tag) and a reader. Data and energy are transmitted without any contact between the tag and the reader. The reader sends out electromagnetic waves that form a magnetic field so the microchip's circuits are powered. The chip modulates the waves and sends back to the reader. The reader converts the new waves into digital data. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is regarded as the future technology for the optimization of supply chain processes. It can improve manufacturing and retail operations, from forecasting demand to planning, managing inventory and distribution. Real time inventory and logistics information is shared at any stage of the supply chain. The supply chain processes gain many benefits from RFID technology. These are better managing and tracking of the supply chain, less time and lower cost for inventory management, lower labor requirement, less inventory shrinkage, improved customer service and better modeling of the customer behavior. RFID provides efficiency, accuracy, visibility and security on the supply chain. Real time inventory and logistics information is shared at any stage of the supply chain by the supplier, manufacturer, distributor and retailer. In this study using a simulation model, the cost differences between an RFID applied and non-applied system are examined on a supply chain consisting of a retailer, distributor and producer. Considering misplacement, shipment error, theft and damage ratios, physical and system inventory levels are determined. The expected benefits obtained through the performance increase of efficiency, accuracy, visibility and security levels are calculated on RFID integrated supply chain considering the lost sales, theft, inventory, order and labor cost factors. The influences of the product value, lead time and demand uncertainty factors are examined on an RFID integrated supply chain by using experimental design. According to the research results, the total supply chain cost savings are increased through the raising product prices. … (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

More and more people use social media to share their real life to the digital world, at the same time, browse the virtual Internet to buy the real products. In the process, a huge amount of data is generated and we investigate the data and crowdsourcing for areas of the public transportation and last-mile delivery for online orders in the perspective of data analytics and operations optimization. We first focus on the transit flow prediction by crowdsourced social media data. Subway flow prediction under event occurrences is a very challenging task in transit system management. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the power of social media data to extract features from crowdsourced content to gather the public travel willingness. We propose a parametric and convex optimization-based approach to combine the least squares of linear regression and the prediction results of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model to accurately predict the NYC subway flow under sporting events. The second part of the thesis focuses on the last-mile same-day delivery with store fulfillment problem (SDD-SFP) using real-world data from a national retailer. We propose that retailers can take advantage of their physical local stores to ful?ll nearby online orders in a direct-to-consumer fashion during the same day that order placed. Optimization models and solution algorithms are developed to determine store selections, fleet-sizing for transportation, and inventory in terms of supply chain seasonal planning. In order to solve large-scale SDD-SFP with real-world datasets, we create an accelerated Benders decomposition approach that integrates the outer search tree and local branching based on mixed-integer programming and develops optimization-based algorithms for initial lifting constraints. In the last part of the dissertation, we drill down SDD-SFP from supply chain planning to supply chain operation level. The aim is to create an optimal exact order ful?llment plan to specify how to deliver each received customer order. We adopt crowdsourced shipping, which utilizes the extra capacity of the vehicles from private drivers to execute delivery jobs on trips, as delivery options, and define the problem as same-day delivery with crowdshipping and store fulfillment (SDD-CSF). we develop a set of exact solution approaches for order fulfillment in form of rolling horizon framework. It repeatedly solves a series of order assignment and delivery plan problem following the timeline in order to construct an optimal fulfillment plan from local stores. Results from numerical experiments derived from real sale data of a retailer along with algorithmic computational results are presented."

Abstract Purpose – This paper seeks to concentrate on the question whether any parallels can be found between the industrial sector and health care services with respect to the developments that have taken place in the area of Supply Chain Management. Starting from an analysis of existing literature, it is intended that different modes of Supply Chain integration will be discussed. Also, in doing so, it is intended that the lessons learned from the studies presented in this special issue will be summarized and placed into the perspective of future research that can be considered as necessary. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopted an exploratory, qualitative approach based on an analysis of existing literature in the area of Supply Chain Management in Health Services. Additionally, material from the case studies presented in this special issue is used to assess the current body of knowledge regarding Supply Chain Management in Health Services. Findings – Starting from a classification of existing research, five main research areas with respect to Supply Chain Management in a health care setting are defined. Additionally, it is concluded that next to studies with a mono-disciplinary focus, an interdisciplinary focus on Supply Chain Management issues in health services seems to be necessary. Originality/value – This paper contributes to both the supply chain management literature and literature in the area of healthcare management by identifying some important research areas which are linked to both fields. This paper helps both academics and managers to gain a better understanding of the complexity of supply chain management in health services."

This is demonstrated in recent NHS history[i]. A business case can be a useful tool to support smart investment by defining the 'why' (strategy) and 'what' (roadmap). This in turn supports the 'how' by acting as the logic model and the framework for evaluation of impact and return on investment. Optimity Advisors has a substantial track record of designing and supporting digital transformation in the UK and US healthcare sectors, and has specific experience in codesigning business cases using the Treasury Five Case Model[ii]. Business case for Digital Investments in healthcare The Strategic Case: The problemAre there alternatives to going digital? What happens if we don't? Who are the stakeholders? The Economic Case: Options appraisalWho will accrue the benefits - patients, providers or commissioners (or a combination?) What are the benefits and how will you measure them? The Commercial Case: Commercial opportunities and risksWho are the vendors? What products are available? What does the supply chain look like? How will you manage it? The Financial Case: Financial implicationsWhat is the initial investment and ongoing maintenance costs? Is sufficient funding available over the lifetime of the proposal? The Management Case: Implementation and delivery risksHow can we avoid the mistakes from previous projects? Are the appropriate governance and management structures in place? Application in the UK context Recently, Optimity worked with an STP[iii] footprint to create a business case for digital investment[iv]: Strategic case: we assessed the gap between the current and 'to-be'; Economic case: we defined the expected output, outcomes and impact over a five-year period; Commercial case: based on analysis of current systems, an open house session will be held to assess options; Financial case: costs were defined for procuring systems, and for project management of the programme; and Management case: the business case is being used as a narrative to get buy-in and define the governance structure. Lessons learned and conclusion: Optimity's experience shows that a business case for digitisation serves multiple purposes in the face of complexity: it defines a strategy, not just solutions to status quo; it's a narrative to bring the right champions on board; it is used as a logic model to define causal relationships; it's also a framework against which impact and RoI can be assessed. Thus, a business case in this context can be a powerful tool to not only define, but also implement and measure change."

Business Continuity is defined as the capability of the organization to continue delivery of products or services at acceptable predefined levels following a disruptive incident. WHAT IS BCP? 4. 1. protect patients. 2. drive continual improvement. 3. increase commissioner confidence. 4. reduce risk of financial loss. 5. safeguard reputation. The next slides will give you an executive overview of the most important steps towards implementing a BCP within your organization… WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A BCP? 5. Ensure you have appointed an emergency officer who is a senior level director. Their role will be to ensure that the legal requirements of Emergency Planning, Resilience and Response (EPRR) are adhered to, so this role needs to sit at a high level within the organization, with influence over both the resources allocated, and the implementation of EPRR throughout all departments. The role should also be supported by a non-executive director. APPOINT AN ACCOUNTABLE EMERGENCY OFFICER. 6. The business continuity policy lays out the fundamentals of your business continuity management system. It should be specific to your healthcare organization, linked to your purpose, activities and services. It needs to clearly stipulate management responsibility for business continuity planning and resource requirements. The policy should be agreed by top management and shared with all internal and external interested parties. ENSURE YOU HAVE DEVELOPED A BUSINESS CONTINUITY POLICY. 7. Set out the business continuity aims and objectives for your organization, as a preliminary business continuity planning stage, considering business strategy, service lines, work streams, support systems, and legal obligations. By ensuring your objectives are SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound), you can use them to check that your policy is consistently adhered to. Objectives and compliance with these must be reviewed periodically at an appropriate committee, to ensure continual improvement. SET OUT YOUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES WITHIN THE POLICY. 8. It is essential to determine which competencies you require staff to have in order to effectively implement business continuity arrangements at different levels within the organization. Establish an emergency response team, involving key work stream leads, define their roles and responsibilities and ensure their competency. Competency can be achieved through a number of routes including training, education and experience. Ensure all support services are included when reviewing competencies. Individual support services will require effective business continuity plans, along with training in their execution. For example, human resources, finance, decontamination, portering, catering, etc. can be essential resources in the event of a business interruption. ESTABLISH ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPETENCIES. 9. Use the organizational risk assessment methodology and a risk matrix to determine the level of risk your organization may be exposed to, both internally and externally, in terms of business strategy, service lines, work streams, support systems, and legal obligations. This will enable you to agree what is acceptable or unacceptable risk to your organization, and to prioritize recovery plans. Plans must be maintained and based on risk-assessed worst-case scenarios. DEFINE CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF RISK. 10. Business impact analysis identifies critical operations, and uses risk-grading to priorities recovery for all work streams. When completed, these enable you to estimate your maximum tolerable periods of disruption and identify your recovery time objectives. Involve a variety of teams to ensure a holistic approach to managing business interruption incidents. Bring work stream leads together to review these and adjust them with an organization- wide perspective. Consider interdependencies between all work streams; for example, the provision and transport of essential medical supplies, blood and blood components, equipment, electricity, access, etc. UNDERTAKE BUSINESS IMPACT ASSESSMENTS FOR ALL WORK STREAMS. 11. Business continuity planning is essential to maintain prioritized activities and to provide a framework for managing events which disrupt normal service. Organizations should ensure that responses to disruption are prompt and effective, and that internal and external communication systems are planned and agreed in advance to allow real-time information sharing. Up to date business continuity plans should consider equipment, procedures, workflows, maps, and staff, client and supplier contact details. Plans must be properly maintained, routinely tested, safely stored and accessible to all work stream leads and their nominated deputies. DEVELOP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS FOR EACH WORK STREAM. 12. Devise reciprocal agreements with neighboring healthcare organizations and ensure these are documented, agreed and revised as necessary. Ensure supply chain risks are managed through assurance from suppliers of their robust business continuity plans. DEVELOP BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS FOR EACH WORK STREAM. 13. It is essential to rehearse and test your business continuity plans; exercises should be conducted at set intervals and top management should be involved. There should be a clearly defined objective for each exercise. Scenarios should take into account both internal and external incidents and supply chains. All work streams should be tested through a programmed approach; exercises should include trigger points, escalation procedures, communications and plan execution. ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN EXERCISING AND TESTING. 14. Following each testing exercise, develop a report detailing what went well, and which areas of the plan require attention and improvement. An action plan assigning responsibility for each action should be developed, including timescales. Corrective actions should be reviewed collectively and objectively to determine whether themes and trends exist, and to identify any underlying problems. Actions should be reviewed to monitor and ensure their completion and their efficacy over time. REPORT ON THE BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN EXERCISES AND CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE PLAN. 15. The key to developing an effective business continuity plan is to perform a Business Impact Analysis which identifies the critical business functions and support functions necessary to meet the various objectives of reestablishing normal patient related functions. Service resilience is essential for any hospital to ensure it can effectively manage risk and ensure continuity of quality patient care in the event of unusual incidents on local, regional, national or global scales.

However, despite the evidences of collaboration benefits, for which some research efforts have been made, there is still a lack of suitable performance indicators and associated metrics to assess those benefits, promoting sustainability and resilience of the members of a collaborative business ecosystem. The analysis of the literature shows that a number of contributions can be found in several research fields, such as enterprise performance indicators, collaboration benefits, value systems, supply chain collaboration, and social network analysis. The purpose of this paper is to survey these areas, highlighting their potential contributions concerning the assessment of collaborative benefits and performance. The analysis also identifies the strengths and weaknesses of current proposals regarding the establishment of adequate performance indicators for collaborative business ecosystems."

The authors introduce a practice about creating a platform for sharing information and knowledge to defend airports against cyber and terror attacks. The threat is shifting from airside to landside, towards public areas. Security should be integrated into the design of the passenger journey, and the security boundary should be extended. This practice not only identifies zones with specific characteristics within the passenger journey but also connects vertical zones to infrastructure outside the airport perimeter. Access control, third-party supply chain and airports being part of a broader business network should not limit security to physical access but also include digital access, including insider threat. This initiative is translating general best practices into solutions against specific risks in determined areas. For cybersecurity as a start, it focuses on the baggage handling system (BHS) being industrial operating machines. Especially this baggage handling is a ‘forgotten’ area for (cyber)security. Airports tend to extend and build on existing equipment and therefore old programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and industrial (digital) equipment designed with an operational focus are still in use and often connected to newly installed machines. Since the main focus within airports is often on other areas, the implementation of European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Std. 3 brings additional risks for BHSs to airports. Creating this (cyber)security information-sharing platform could build a road map for security to be shared with other airports. Implementation of location-based security, through monitoring of communication of surrounding control systems, will input identified specific BHS threats into the platform. After this first assessment of the BHS, the scope and the number of airports or external parties involved could be expanded."

A case study of the electronic national agriculture market platform is undertaken to understand the predictors in the context of a real project. The study has revealed significant predictors of priority (high to low) as fast transaction cycles, higher prices, easier to use, infrastructure availability, trust, social influence, low transaction costs and customer care. Post-adoption, the user expects to get benefits like transparency, quick trade settlement, reduced transaction cost, expanding the market reach, and increase in the product price realized by the farmer. The improvement in the critical predictors of the electronic trading platform may help the de-facto national initiative to succeed.

The approach is presented by the variance cube of purchasing (VCP) that involves a lean method for variance optimisation, namely the cost and variance driver analysis. The approach focuses on the optimisation and the control of existing process variance within the supply chain. The application of the cube is presented by a case study involving a globally acting Tier 1 supplier, who produces steering systems for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. In this case, the sourcing process of this Tier 1 supplier will be analysed, evaluated and optimised regarding variance. The variance is presented in the form of the number of suppliers who are involved in the sourcing process. Unnecessary existing process variance, like an unnecessary huge number of suppliers within the sourcing process, is a type of waste. Time, money, quality and technology can be saved through a greater understanding of the optimal number of suppliers within a sourcing process. The results of the case study led to a generalised method to optimise the existing process variance, present cost improvements as well as optimising the key performance indicator to manage the number of suppliers in the sourcing process. The general approach can be used for other company departments like logistics and for different industries other than automotive. The insights of this article support the operative user and the strategic company management in order to reduce and improve unnecessary variance in different sections. The structured analysis of supply chain process variance via the VCP and the key performance indicator “optimal supplier number per sourcing process” are new to company management."

Virtual fitting-room technologies can provide information about how a product fits a particular customer in a novel way and mitigate the stress that the existing information gap generates in the retailer’s supply chain. By implementing a series of randomized field experiments, we study the value of virtual fit information in online retail. Customers are randomly assigned to a treatment condition where virtual fit information is available or to a control condition where virtual fit information is not available. Our results show that offering virtual fit information increases conversion, basket sizes, average price of purchased products, and revisits to the site, while reducing fulfillment costs arising from returns and home try-on behavior, e.g., customers ordering multiple sizes of the same product. Furthermore, we find the effects are more intense for products that are more expensive and those with more sizes available.

The determinants of innovative transformation of retail business models are characterized, which allow, based on internal and external conditions, to critically rethink and adjust the basic principle by which value is created. The need to search for ideas of the latest business models of retail trade, on the basis of which enterprises will be able to be successful and grow rapidly in the conditions of digitalization, is proved. A scientific generalization and systematization of business models of value creation in both off-line and on-line channels is carried out. According to the model of Graf and Schneider, a value chain is defined, which is based on the following primary activities: supply (range, focused on demand); presentation of the product (photo of the product, listing, recommendations, text); marketing and sales (off-line marketing, on-line marketing, sales channels); executing sale and purchase (issue of check, payment methods, risk analysis); logistics (delivery of goods, management of return of goods); customer service (dialogue with the client in social networks, hot-line, chat, on-line self-service). These determinants in the course of value creation can be materialized on the basis of innovative approaches, through multichannel sales, use of brands, pricing management, integration of customers into various processes and shopper marketing (buying marketing), which allows to focus on the decision-making process from the first opinion of the consumer about the purchase of goods and further on, during making the choice. It is noted that the rapid response to changes, the proactive search for new ideas and high readiness for digitalization are triggers of the successful transformation of the business model of retailers in the digital revolution. As the main competencies at the retail enterprises the author defines innovation, digital intelligence and personalization, which must be adequately used to win the competition."

This paper aims to explore radical solutions to the renovation process through the development and adoption of BIM-based workflow processes and technologies. A case study of renovating the famous Durham Cathedral has been used to explore the aim of this research. The proposed workflow started with laser scanning to capture the interior of the church. Then a 3D model of the asset was developed to provide accurate information on the current state and layout of the building as a single accessible reliable resource, which had previously been lacking. The model provided a range of functions such as scenario planning and mobile virtual tours which were difficult to achieve with the traditional pre-BIM workflow. Condition surveys interlinked with the model were created, along with maintenance schedules for the team, which may provide time and cost savings compared to the traditional maintenance procedures.

Food, culture and fashion are among the elements that characterize Italy in the world. The Mediterranean diet, its products and its dishes are imitated in every part of the globe with ""Italian sounding"" products. The economic data for 2017 show that the PDO and PGI production in Italy have a value of 15.2 billion euro, equal to 18% of the total turnover of the national agri-food sector. On the export front, the Made in Italy quality production continues to grow, reaching euro 8.8 billion in 2017, accounting for 21% of Italian agri-food exports. The complexity and the value of the agri-food chain are the reasons behind the technology sector, and in particular of blockchain-based projects. The focus on the food market must be sought in the challenges it faces such as the fight against fraud and counterfeiting, food security and the redistribution of value along the supply chain. It is not only the need for transparency, however, that makes the agri-food sector an ideal ally of blockchain technology. Historically, the food production sector and, in particular, agricultural products, have been characterized by the presence of small and medium-sized producers, characterized by their low bargaining power. Within this context, the blockchain can play a leading role in the exchange of goods and services that make it possible to democratize the supply process, making the relationship between small farmers and big buyers fairer. The main elements that motivated the research on the Blockchian Partenership Iinitiative were to reduce the information asymmetry, trying to decrease the distance between producers and consumers, and making the ""value"" of the suppli chain of quality products PDO quality and PGI through the Distributed Ledger Technologies, therefore in the supply chain there are some phases of the process that are not officially codified, which represent a gap to be filled to protect the consumer."

Many challenges, however, exist and undermine its effective implementation within the construction industry. The identification of these challenges is critical to the successful implementation and adoption of BIM, especially in view of many implementation risks. Despite the critical role of the design phase to project delivery and BIM usage, few studies have sought to interrogate the challenges faced by designers and the solutions that are being applied to address them. To address this gap, this study aimed to identify and classify challenges faced by designers with particular focus on proposed solutions for alleviating the identified challenges. Through a qualitative research strategy, semi-structured interviews were used to solicit perspectives of UK design professionals on design profession-specific BIM implementation challenges and solutions. Findings reveal that challenges are mostly organisational and external environmental issues with rather cursory allusion to technological challenges which are widely reported in the literature. The solutions identified for alleviating designers’ BIM implementation challenges include earlier input and integration from whole supply chain as well as more support institutional support and facilitation. The promotion of open-BIM standards, tailored insurance as well as principal supplier leadership were also proposed as viable solutions to BIM implementation challenges. Variations in the challenges and proposed solutions appear to differ across different categories of firms investigated in this study, particularly in relation to the cost of implementation."

Abstract Purpose – The aim of this study is to discuss the relationship between e-procurement and supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – Both interviews with practicing managers and an empirical study were conducted in the current study. Interviews with four practicing managers were conducted to gather the practical insights of the theoretical framework. Empirical data were collected from 108 Taiwanese enterprises. Findings – The paper found that partner relationships, information sharing, and supply chain integration can represent the processes through which e-procurement contributes to supply chain performance. Supply chain integration has the highest standardized total effect on supply chain performance. Research limitations/implications – Future studies could more systematically analyze the relationships among e-procurement, supply chain integration and supply chain performance. Cross-level analysis is also worthy of investigation when considering the influence of technology-usage characteristics. Practical implications – Compared to partner relationships and information sharing, supply chain integration has more influences on supply chain performance. Therefore, this study suggests that a joint-learning practice can be implemented for properly managing supply chains (e.g. know-how collaboration, mutual competency creation). Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature by proposing and testing the influences of partner relationships, information sharing, and supply chain integration. This allows a strategic viewpoint when implementing e-procurement systems intended to improve supply chain performance."

The approaches and results for stakeholders’ engagement, barrier mitigation, DIH structure and activities are presented. So far, more than 100 stakeholders have been engaged, more than 50 business opportunities have been promoted and a set of support services and events have been carried out. Main lessons learned are (1) about the relevance of understanding the needs of stakeholders, (2) impact is bigger when relevant regional industries (rather than academia/technology providers) discuss the technologies they have integrated and how these have improved efficiency or added value to their processes, and (3) about the importance of the communication plan and a well-formed DIH service definition."

Abstract Purpose – Global sourcing can bring many benefits to organisations, but it can also expose them to a number of risks. The purpose of this study is to understand how managers assess global sourcing risks across the entire supply chain and what actions they take to mitigate those risks. Design/methodology/approach – A multiple case study approach was used, involving 15 cases in seven different industries. Each case consisted of interviews with managers directly involved in the global sourcing decision, supported by documentary evidence. A cross-case analysis was conducted to analyse patterns across different industries. Findings – The study revealed that most companies do not have a structured supply chain risk management and mitigation system. Nevertheless they do use a number of informal approaches to cope with risk. The paper proposes that a multidisciplinary approach is required when dealing with global sourcing risks. It presents a classification of risks covering four categories: supply risk, process and control risks, environmental and sustainability risks, and demand risks. Originality/value – The paper addresses a research gap concerning managers' approaches to assessing and mitigating supply chain risk in a global context. In this context, this study proposes a new categorisation for global sourcing risks and offers a characterisation of global sourcing risk mitigation strategies applicable to different industries."

Abstract Purpose – The objective of this exploratory paper is to find out what is important to consider when developing a supply chain in health care, what is required in order to establish a supply chain orientation and how lean and agile can be used as process strategies in order to improve supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – In order to build an empirical framework for using both lean and agile strategies in health care supply chain management illustrative examples are provided from a Swedish health care setting describing the patient flow and planning processes. Findings – Supply chain management has potential to work well as a philosophy for patient flow in the health care sector. However, it should not only be about the use of the concept of lean in health care, as in fact is the case in practice today. It is rather about organizing for quick response and flexibility in a hybrid strategy through combining lean and agile process strategies. This can only be done if a systems approach is applied together with a strategic orientation, where cooperative efforts by the supply chain members should synchronize and converge operational as well as strategic capabilities into a unified whole. Practical implications – The analysis in the paper underlines the importance of focusing on both agility and leanness combined. Hospitals or health care systems that introduce such an approach, as opposed to only relying on lean strategies, could gain both competitive advantages and improved performance. Originality/value – In health care, even more so than in the manufacturing industry, containment of costs without sacrificing quality is important. This paper applies SCM techniques, tools and concepts that have not been used previously for patient flow in a health care setting, combining lean and agile in one and the same analysis."

A reliable traceability system based on radio frequency identification devices (RFID) is proposed in this paper. Specific requirements of the food digital ID are analyzed, and six requirements of communications security, system availability, data authenticity, information privacy, data authority, traceability are listed. An asymmetric encryption algorithm NTRU and a digital signature algorithm based on NTRU are developed to design secure authentication protocol and food digital ID. Firstly the public key, private key and digital certificate of all nodes in the supply chain are issued by a trusted third-party certification authority, correspondingly the RFID tag's ID of the node is recorded and the encrypted product information is written to the RFID tag, thus creating a digital ID. Then the certification process among the nodes using the digital ID is demonstrated in detail. The node's reader generates a random number R and Q, and transmits to tags, where Q is the encrypted data with result of XOR operation of R and reader's serial number K using its private key by NTRU. After receiving the Q and R, the tags decrypt and calculate K with a corresponding reader's public key. If the K is one of the reader's serial number stored in RFID tag, it is accepted to the next communication, otherwise is denied to the next communication. After successful authentication, the tag calculates M and transmits to reader, where M is the encrypted data with result of XOR operation of R and tag's ID using the reader's public key by NTRU. After received the M, the reader decrypts and calculates tag's ID with its private key. If the tag's ID is one of the tag's ID stored in reader, the reader accepts the next communication, otherwise denies the next communication. Through these steps, the reader and the tag establish a trusted channel to read or write. Finally, the security is discussed and well fit with the safety requirements of the food digital ID, thus the food digital ID is accomplished. With secure authentication protocol, electronic receipt of wine logistics using the food digital ID is achieved. With the electronic receipt of wine logistics, the four roles of manufacturers, sales, consumers, certification centers are designed, the four procedures of registration and certification, information of manufacturer written to the tag, information of vendors written to the tag, consumers verification are developed. The application prototype system is built in wine logistics, fundamentally improving the security and reliability of wine logistics according to analysis of its security. Food digital ID and electronic receipt of wine logistics are proposed in this paper, the work will be of great interest for use in safe and reliable supervision and management for food quality."

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce retail sales for 2002 reached at $45.6 billion, an increase of 26.9% from 2001, while total retail sales increased 3.1% during the same period. Although e-commerce sales account for only 1.4% of total sales, the digital economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than earlier predicted. The logistical requirements of e-commerce goods may stimulate greater complexity in supply chain management and potentially cause higher costs in carrier fleet operations. It is important to encourage the development of a freight transportation system that will support the steady growth of e-commerce, while avoiding the possible negative effects from the changes in freight transportation.

According to the results, 51% to 59% of internal stored communication was digital adding up to 52-58% when external communication was included. The degree of internal digitalisation correlated better with the outbound than with the inbound communication. In one case, a publication pattern dominated the communication. In another case, a digitalised supply chain pattern drove the digitalisation. In the third case, the internal verbal coordination and the publication pattern were both present. These results suggest that the dominating patterns have major impact on media selection in organisations and guide the digitalisation and emergence of new business information systems.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework for mapping the Indian Public Distribution System (PDS) using multi-agent system (MAS). The entire PDS supply chain from purchase to the distribution is mapped in detail by integrating stages of PDS supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Literature related to PDS, food grain supply chain (FGSC) and MAS is reviewed and critically assessed. Based on this a framework is proposed which will help in improving functioning of PDS. Findings – The PDS has many shortcomings arising from its complex structure and practices which are used to implement it. The authors propose an MAS to model it in which each entity will be modelled as an agent. The authors propose two stages of supply chain. First stage models the processes from procurement to storage of food grain and second stage model the distribution process. Practical implications – This paper will be of interest to the policy makers and decision makers involved in the PDS by providing the shortfalls in the system and also suggesting a method to model the PDS based on practices of food supply chains. Originality/value – This paper provides the decision makers in the PDS, a framework to model and assess the entire supply chain. This will help them in effective implementation of the PDS and also improve in the areas of concerns which are pointed the study."

To understand these processes, this study explores the experiences of six diverse Saudi firms as case studies: an air transport data system, vertical integration of global firms' subsidiaries, a value chain system, and entrepreneurs taking advantage of cloud opportunities. Rather than following the literature in focusing on the decision making steps to upgrade organizational data-based resources, this research considers how the firms integrated cloud technologies with their existing or new business models. The case studies were conducted post-implementation of cloud data projects to qualitatively assess the expectations of owners and executives of firms from their initiatives.Overall, the findings were that firms' experiences when online resulted in better integration with upstream international suppliers, greater cost control, and adapted and new business model advantages. Of the cases, two retailers and an intermediary/retail stationer used their new cloud-based data resources by expanding to online sales platforms. The largest firm was able to use its industry leadership to develop online data integration with firms through its value chains. The remaining firms were more circumspect. The data infrastructure firm merely formed a cloud sibling company to enhance its core business. The airline's industry data provider moved all its clients to cloud services, and the wholesaler similarly agreed to contract with its value chain's digital provider.This paper is presented as an introduction including the purpose of the study, a short literature review, methodology, results, comparative analysis, and conclusions. There was insufficient opportunity to provide a detailed discussion placing the cases into previous findings, although this empirical study is focussed on cloud migration outcomes rather than change factors."

As labor costs are high, several industries have suffered severely under the relocation of production facilities towards aspiring countries, which have managed to close the productivity and quality gap substantially. Established manufacturing companies have recognized that customers are not willing to pay large price premiums for incremental quality improvements. As a consequence, many companies from the German manufacturing industry adjust their production focusing on customized products and fast time to market. Leveraging the advantages of novel production strategies such as Agile Manufacturing and Mass Customization, manufacturing companies transform into integrated networks, in which companies unite their core competencies. Hereby, virtualization of the process-and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating entities. Boundaries of companies deteriorate, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. By including Cyber-Physical-Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-topics into the respective research field. To assess the practical implications, we conducted face-to-face interviews with managers from the industry as well as from the consulting business using a structured interview guideline. The results reveal reasons for the adaption and refusal of Industry 4.0 practices from a managerial point of view. Our findings contribute to the upcoming research stream of Industry 4.0 and support decision-makers to assess their need for transformation towards Industry 4.0 practices."

Millennials, CX, B2C and B2B, AI, for instance, are key terms in marketing today. B2B buyers expect a more B2C-like CX, and B2B vendors need to provide them actionable insights, companies are trying to get competitive advantage by truly aligning marketing and sales, and the more customer-centric economy is favoring CRM startups, while CX is empowered by building an integrated CRM. Marketers are under pressure of holistically thinking about the customer journey, and overcoming his anxiety and friction, by considering adequate supply chain actions in response. Within the current more complex general context there is a real need of updating CMO's responsibilities, the more so we are witnessing customers' purchasing's increase influenced more by the mental cost. Marketing differentiators, Millennials, CX, B2C and B2B, AI Staying relevant to Millennials' habits and preferences (Gen Y, age 23 to 38, different tastes and more spending power than other generations) it is a real challenge in the current market. Marketers need to create adequate marketing campaigns on the basis of proper strategies such as: building environmental appeal (thanks to good social and environmental practices), identifying ways to give back to communities and nonprofit organizations (demonstrating a sense of purpose beyond profits), creating personalized campaigns (stimulating one-on-one relationships), enhancing their digital presence (engaging with customers on social networks and generating direct interactions). (Washburn, 2020) As in the current digital era a moment of great importance in customers'/users' journeys is the onboarding, while trying to increase product adoption and usage marketers can, for instance, to improve the onboarding experience by using a combination of in-app engagements, reengage inactive users via email, rethink the way they measure onboarding with regard to its impact on revenue. (Upton, 2020) Of course, such an approach involves first of all ensuring an optimized product experience for the user, and using in-app engagements (but not too many), and then (after improving the onboarding experience) providing in-app support (so as to turn an eventual negative moment into a positive one instantly), and ensuring an user-focused product experience (by adequately exploring different personas, working with prospect-and customer-facing teams to gather the necessary feedback, and using usage data to derive insights)."

The proposals put forward are based on an analysis of the potential of the Russian railways and its implications for the spatial development of the Russian Federation. The trends in the development of unmanned vehicles are analyzed and it is concluded that its implementation in Russia will require the construction of specialized road, energy and digital infrastructure with the appropriate allocation of land allocation and supply of energy, communications and other technological communications. The need to search for new scientific, technological and organizational solutions is shown to achieve synergy between the demand for container road transport and the infrastructural and technological capabilities available in the railway transport system. As such a decision, the expediency of developing a new Intelligent Multimodal Transport System under the auspices of the Russian Railways was substantiated. Priority directions for the development of this system, as well as technical and investment solutions and scientific and technological tasks necessary for its implementation, have been determined. At the same time, questions have been formulated that require scientific study. The advantages of the proposed system for increasing the efficiency of using the transport space and developing a breakthrough competitive infrastructure business of the Russian Railways are disclosed.

Abstract: The question may be asked why many workers are still being paid below subsistence wages and I believe the answer can be found in the confusion over what exactly constitutes a ""living wage"" and who has the duty to pay these wages. This article therefore clarifies what a living wage is and gives a concrete example of how a living wage can be calcu-lated. To understand who has the obligation to pay living wages I look to the theory of Alan Gewirth on individual and institutional responsibility and the account of Robert Mayer on structural exploitation to argue that all parts of the supply chain have the duty. The final part of this paper will outline the inclusion of a living wage calculation into corporate codes of conduct to ensure that workers at the end of the supply chain receive living wages."

The analysis (1) identifies and describes design practices that the company initiated to support service innovation (including new products, processes and business models) (2) identifies challenges in adopting and institutionalising such practices. The results show that the company supports both externally and internally oriented design practices – and loosens the boundary between the two – through the activities in the Fung Academy and a new innovation hub, Explorium, with a particular focus on utilising digital technologies. Specifically, the study demonstrates how the company empowers and involves a variety of stakeholders (individuals, groups, and organisations) in value co-creating practices involving absorptive, collaborative, and adaptive practices that aim to challenge or disrupt current practices.

These problems can be partially solved by ensuring a continuous and reliable flow of information regarding the quality parameters of wood pellets from the producers to the final users. The aim of this work is to define a metric index for quality parameters that can detect the certifiability of analyzed samples compared with those on the market. The model is built on measured quality parameters of certified and non-certified wood pellet samples taken from products on the market applying a multivariate class modelling methodology (soft independent modelling of class analogy, SIMCA). Results showed that the model can predict the general quality of some test samples and that its precision, already fairly high, can be constantly improved by adding new model samples. The output of the model is also the relative influence (modelling power) of each variable in the prediction of certifiability. The SIMCA model could be easily integrated and implemented on the most common digital platforms where users (private, laboratories, agencies, etc.) could test their samples and verify if the index of their pellet falls within the area defined by the model for certified samples."

These plans also require a new understanding of crisis management, employee support, and collaboration and communications to support management in a large-scale supply chain disruption. Supply chain disruptions can be mitigated via the new capabilities of the collaboration and communications platform. During a crisis, a number of conditions occur that affect supply chains.

This article draws on stakeholder theory to examine the deployment of blockchain technology in the music streaming sector, in order to assess how these blockchain-based innovations - via interactions with users, market environments, and overarching economic and political frameworks - are contributing to evolving conceptions of ownership, inclusion and involvement. Initially, the article examines three approaches to theorizing and designing inclusive governance structures that acknowledge the distributed, and at times collaborative, nature of interaction between members of a group; be that a society, a company or other form of organized grouping. Here I draw on three discourses to underpin the evolving role that stakeholders - in the guise of networks, companies, societies and platforms – can play in digital commerce: (i) John Rawls’ concept of Distributive Justice, (ii) a set of principles known as the ‘Scandinavian approach to Participatory Design’; and (iii) the emergent concept of ‘New Economics,’ a term particularly associated with current and emergent left-wing political perspectives in the United Kingdom. Taking three use cases in Resonate, Musicoin and Choon, the article engages with how blockchain-based music start-ups are interacting with an evolving marketplace; identifying the benefits and beneficiaries of blockchain uptake, along with a wider set of structural changes that are taking place within music commerce. The article focuses on music streaming in particular to explore how blockchain is transforming the way that things are owned, and how it is contributing to an evolving conception of ownership, and reflects on how blockchain is finding increased used within the physical world of private and public property, and political governance. In response to this integrative analysis of blockchain in relation to critical perspectives on ownership and governance, the article concludes by considering how stakeholders with the music streaming sector are indicative of wider changes, challenges and tensions within the digital marketplace, and the role that innovations in blockchain can play in this transition."

Whenever, any organization select its suppliers then organization evaluates every supplier with respect to certain criteria, which are already listed in the organization’s policies. Since supplier selection is based on the evaluation of various attributes of each alternative; therefore this problem is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model for selecting the best supplier. Design/methodology/approach – This paper reports the implementation of grey theory to choose the appropriate supplier with uncertain information. Grey values have been used to give the ratings and weightage to various criteria which are being used to evaluate the different supplier alternatives. And finally the grey possibility degree has been calculated to rate the various alternatives. Findings – This paper proposed a MADM model based on grey theory to select the optimal supplier and finally, the proposed model has been applied to select the best supplier for “optimizing digital banking” in the Indian context. Research limitations/implications – The selection criteria selected here through literature review may not fit the whole industry and moreover this paper can be extended into the field where multiple-supplier selection is required, like in manufacturing sector where the authors cannot rely always on single supplier. So, in that case the authors need to pick more than one best alternatives. Practical implications – The grey theory approach can be applied almost all the services industries, where the exact information about the suppliers in quantitative terms is very difficult to find. So the authors can use the grey numbers to rate the suppliers. Social implications – Since, the coming generation is more dependent on the internet banking, so it becomes very much necessary for the banking sector to update the existing system. Due to lack in technical skills, outsourcing the information technology and software development is the best option. Hence, Grey theory based model can be used in selecting the best supplier under uncertain information. Originality/value – Very few studies have been done in India using grey theory approach for supplier selection and moreover, to the best knowledge of the authors’ this is the first study which employs grey theory for selecting the best supplier in banking industry. Moreover the digital banking system is the future of banking industry, so every player should provide the digital banking structure in order to survive in the market."

Summary Purpose – This paper aims to perform an empirical investigation about the constructs and indicators of the supply chain management practices framework. Design/methodology/approach – The measuring framework proposed is based on a survey that was carried out on 107 Brazilian companies. Statistical techniques were employed to verify, validate, and test the reliability of the constructs and their indicators. To validate this framework principal component analysis and structural equation modeling techniques were used. Findings – In general, previous studies suggest six constructs for measuring the supply chain management practices framework. However, in this study a framework was achieved with four constructs of supply chain management practices, namely, supply chain (SC) integration for production planning and control (PPC) support, information sharing about products and targeting strategies, strategic relationship with customer and supplier, and support customer order. This framework has adequate levels of validity and reliability. Research limitations/implications – The main limitation of this study was that only a small sample of companies in a single sector and country were surveyed, and therefore there needs to be further research considering the special conditions in other countries. Originality/value – This study investigated statistically set indicators to discuss the topic ''supply chain management practices''. The framework obtained has good quality of validity and reliability indicators. Thus, an alternative framework has been added to measure supply chain management practices, which is currently a popular topic in the supply chain mainstream literature. Both defined constructs and the validated indicators can be used in other studies on supply chain management."

The development required design of new standard, forwarder independent approach to logistics business information exchange, covering all transport modes and all stakeholders. The developed XML-based messaging framework and access point infrastructure enable the implementation of interoperable digital transport solutions at different stages of the transport process (booking, planning , monitoring, and completion). In the monitoring solution, notifications on the departure and arrival of shipments are received via Transport Status messages in real-time. The information transmitted can be manually input or it can come from automated identification solutions utilizing a variety of technologies like barcodes and RFID. The functional viewpoint of the monitoring application consists of two perspectives: the logistics service consumer (LSC) and the logistics service provider (LSP). Accommodating for both roles in one application offers some synergies compared to individual and dedicated solutions. Finally, the solution was tested in a business case to evaluate the benefits and weaknesses of the proposed solution comparing to predominant centralized solutions. 1. Introduction Effective logistics and supply chain management (SCM) requires sharing knowledge and information along the supply chain. Primarily companies adopt information and communication technology (ICT) solutions in logistics and freight transportation in order to save costs and enhance service level, but also to improve the control and monitoring of the transportation processes [1]. There is a common understanding that due to rapid development of ICT solutions, companies that are not using ICT technologies in their SCM cannot stay competitive in markets (e.g., [2]). Despite the current consensus of importance of ICT adoption in logistics and freight transport management, the literature has paid little attention to the alternative application types of systems [1]. Mostly, available ICT solutions are centralized , based on dominant logistics service provider (LSP) company's systems [3]. Therefore its user companies are forced to invest in those specific systems resulting minor possibilities especially for small-and medium-sized companies to change their LSP [4]. To avoid these kinds of lock-in situations in material flow tracking, Kärkkäinen et al. [5] present an alternative approach in short-term multi-company distribution networks. Their forwarder independent tracking approach is based on standardized form of identifier, in which location data are available for all the companies requiring the data independent of the company handling the goods [5]. SCM and purchasing literature points out the importance of integration between supply chain companies. That integration includes long-term and good-quality relationships between buyer and its suppliers [6,7]. This viewpoint can be seen to favor ICT solutions that connect companies tightly with its LSPs. However, the integration with certain downstream and upstream companies does not necessary increase the performance of the whole supply chain [8]. In addition, tight connection to certain inter-organizational information system (IOIS) solution may change the dynamics of the supply chain, which may even be harmful for certain companies [9-11]. Therefore this paper has enlarged the scope of for-warder independent tracking system solution proposed by Kärkkäinen et al. [5] to cover all freight information exchange and examines the benefits of a standard framework for freight information exchange covering all transport modes and all stakeholders. The paper is organized as follows: The research design is presented below. Theoretical background Section 3 starts by considering the differences between centralized ICT systems with the proposed solution from SCM point of view,"

A customized sixth-order low pass filter with two additional zeroes Chebyshev-I filter is adopted to enhance the average adjacent channel rejection (ACR) and the attenuation at 5.25 MHz, and a novel programmable gain amplifier (PGA) realizes accurate gains with a fine-tuning gain step of 0.25 dB. The digitally assisted real-time dc offset cancellation (DCOC) loop can prevent the BB chain from saturation robustly with a low residual output dc offset voltage (DCOV) and an extremely low cut-off frequency. The digitally assisted complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF)-based on-chip automatic gain control (AGC) loop implements reliable amplitude control for digital TV signals with a large peak to average power ratio (PAPR). The BB chain fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process occupies an area of 1.2 mm2 and consumes a current of 21.3 mA from 1.8-V supply including the output buffer. It achieves a maximum gain of 62 dB and a DR of 68 dB with 0.25 dB minimum step. The attenuation at 5.25 MHz is 48.6 dB and the average ACR is 38.2 dB.

Together with a well-established regional stratigraphic framework from the neighboring Bahamian island chain and detailed field mapping, the West Caicos data set provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of the link between carbonate stratigraphy and the controlling parameters of sea level, sediment supply, tectonics, and climate. The exceptionally well-preserved stratigraphic record of the mid–late Pleistocene from West Caicos allows recognition of marine isotope stages (MIS) 9/11, 5e, and Holocene. The west coast of the island provides a continuous 8.4 km exposure of the MIS 5e record that enhances our understanding of the intra-MIS 5e bipartite succession in this region and supports a sea-level lowering that occurred during the last interglacial (LIG). West Caicos accreted as a series of eolian, foreshore–shoreface, barrier-reef, and fringing-reef facies. Shoreline positions for all but the MIS 7 and MIS 5a/c deposits are now captured in the sub-meter geodetic-quality topobathy lidar survey. The Star Town unit of MIS 9/11 age forms the southern margin of the island as well as the central karst-modified spine, with uranium–thorium (U–Th) coral ages of between 368 and 365 thousand years ago (ka) and a D/L Glu average of >0.60. Early MIS 5e strata include the Railroad Ridge unit in the center of the island, which was previously identified as one of the older units. The Railroad Ridge unit is a north–south linear dune ridge that has a D/L Glu average of 0.52 and indicates the onset of sediment sources from the east associated with a flooded central Caicos Platform. Approximately synchronously, the early MIS 5e South Reef unit (+3.75–4 m sea-level elevation) nucleated on the western coast of West Caicos, attached to the middle Pleistocene Star Town unit. The South Reef corals yield an average coral U–Th age of 126.5 ka, with an average D/L Glu from skeletal matrix of 0.46. This transitional barrier/fringing reef is unconformably overlain by the late MIS 5e Boat Cove unit. Corals in the basal transgressive phase of this upper MIS 5e Boat Cove unit yield an average 120.6 ka U–Th and average D/L Glu of 0.45. Shallow-marine, foreshore, and eolian facies of the late MIS 5e rest on a wave-cut terrace that cuts the early MIS 5e South Reef unit by as much as 3 m down to a +0.5 m above present sea-level elevation. The upper MIS 5e Boat Cove unit displays a maximum of +4.5 m elevation above present-day sea level, measured from the middle of the foreshore. This estimate may be a minimum value as the exposures on the west coast are part of a forced regressive foreshore sequence. Last stages of the upper MIS 5e deposition are seen in a series of regressive dune-beach ridge deposits referred to as the Northeast Ridges unit, with sea-level positions ranging from +4.5 m early in the central part of West Caicos, to +0.5 m on the far northeast coast, eventually building down below present-day sea level. This sea-level history fits well with previously documented records in the Bahamas and globally, and the extensive erosion supports a short-lived (between 126 and 120 ka) intra-MIS 5e relative-sea-level fall. Holocene deposition on West Caicos is restricted to northern and eastern margins of the island as a combination of strandplain and dune ridge mixed skeletal–oolitic units. Using the high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and linked digital geologic map makes it possible to compare areas of the different Pleistocene and Holocene units quantitatively and to constrain volumetric assessments and accumulation rates on the island for different units. The peak sediment volume production/accumulation rate—between 6.5 and 8 × 106 m3 or between 2.2 and 2.7 × 106 m3 per ka—is observed in the upper MIS 5e unit. This rate is 5 times greater than the 0.5 × 106 m3 per ka estimated for the Holocene ooid dune-ridge/strandplain complex, suggesting that the combination of higher sea level, greater wave and wind energy, and warmer ocean temperatures may have fostered the higher rate of chemically precipitated sediment supply."

Abstract Purpose – To investigate how supply-chain partners can achieve collaboration under varying circumstances (transactional types) by developing trust-based social foundations and by utilizing electronically mediated exchange. Design/methodology/approach – A conceptual framework illustrates the roles of trust and electronically mediated exchange in achieving collaboration and its hypotheses are tested with a sample of 157 supply-chain relationships of international subsidiaries of Nordic multinational corporations (MNCs). Findings – Finds that collaborative partnerships can be achieved both via trust and through electronically mediated exchange. Results also indicate that electronically mediated exchange more readily enhances collaboration in exchange relationships involving standardized products, while trust plays a larger role when customized products are being exchanged. Research limitations/implications – The transactional type involved impacts the relative effectiveness of trust and electronically mediated exchange in achieving collaboration. This finding might stimulate research of the impact of other contextual factors. Limitations include that only managers on one side of inter-organizational dyads were surveyed. Practical implications – Practicing managers need to prioritize the time and effort they spend developing partnerships. While both trust and electronically mediated exchange play pivotal roles in fostering collaboration, managers involved in the exchange of standardized products can place a relative emphasis on electronically mediated exchange, while trust is of higher importance when customized products are being exchanged. Originality/value – This paper examines the complex interplay of trust and electronically mediated exchange in achieving collaborative supply-chain partnerships and offers guidance to practicing managers as well as implications of theoretical interest to academics."

Today, the market place is flooded with several e-commerce options for shoppers to choose from. A variety of innovative products and services are being offered spoiling customers for choice. Online shopping is no more a privilege enjoyed by your friends and family living in the US or UK. Today, it is a reality in India. In the last couple of years, the growth of e-commerce industry in India has been phenomenal as more shoppers have started discovering the benefits of using this platform. There is enough scope for online businesses in the future if they understand the Indian shopper's psyche and cater to their needs. Diverse e-commerce applications are being implemented in the textile and apparel supply chain. This paper includes use of e-commerce, with analyses of the use and impact of e-commerce in textile industry in India. Benefits of e-commerce include global marketing opportunities for products and markets. However, a key limitation of e-commerce is the risk of channel conflict between existing customers and new profile customers.

Compared with the published similar method, the whole signal chain of the new sensor is quasi-digital and without low-pass filter and analog-to-digital converter required when connected to digital systems. A precisely theoretical equation with respect to the linear dependence between the duty cycle and the current to be measured is established.

The sensor linearity is improved using the least-squares polynomial fitting method. Some key specifications including the linearity, repeatability, and power supply effect of the sensor are characterized.

At Agbogbloshie, despite the intentions of national Ghanaian regulations and hazardous waste laws, most e-waste is untreated or crudely processed via burning or acid baths. These practices release dioxins, furans, and heavy metals into the environment, invariably harming scrapyard workers, their families, and the greater urban community of Accra. However, the scrapyard also provides a critical source of livelihood for some of Ghana's most poor, vulnerable, and unskilled migrants. The aim and objective of this study is to humanize the conundrums and challenges that e-waste invokes in places such as Ghana. Based on extensive and original field research—including expert interviews, community interviews with scrapyard workers and families, and naturalistic observation at waste sites and other parts of the e-waste supply chain—this study asks: What benefits has e-waste brought communities in Ghana? What risks has it created? And, critically, what policies need implemented to make e-waste more sustainable? It documents ten ostensible benefits of e-waste alongside ten very real and growing risks.

The “virtual cluster” phenomenon highlights the most significant effect of the development of the information and communication technologies in the business environment. A virtual cluster is conceived as an e-business community, made up of customers, suppliers, distributors and commerce providers sharing digital and knowledge networks for collaboration and competition. The purpose of this paper is to set out the characteristics of a new competitive space, in which a strategic role is played by virtual processes among partners, and to review the traditional sources of clustering in the digital economy environment (Romano et al., 1999). More specifically, this paper attempts to show the emerging overlap between digital and knowledge networks, which generates a new competitive space within a new global-virtual learning environment. Finally, assuming that traditional sources of clustering are generally identified in specialisation (based on a sophisticated division of labour) and geographic proximity, the paper discusses how the role of organisational proximity acts as a substitute for geographic proximity in supporting coordination and tacit knowledge exchange. As it emerges from the analysis of our cases, from a managerial point of view, organisational proximity may be achieved through the implementation of supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) strategies.

It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid.

Bitcoin is an example which bypasses the need for a bank to achieve transparent transactions. Industrial applications are asset tracking, authentication, and the Internet of Things (IOT). Design(s): We reviewed commercially available Blockchain systems (IBM, Microsoft), emerging platforms (GemOS), and published literature on Blockchain within healthcare. Taking into account the limits and power of Blockchain, we proposed innovative pathology applications through the following use cases. Result(s): Surgical specimen tracking: Pathology departments alongside IT could utilize libraries in the emerging Blockchain marketplace based on the Ethereum platform such as Microsoft Azure for implementing affordable, home grown asset tracking solutions (Fig 1). ""Public"" pathology record system: A pathology ""on chain"" record can be accessed (securely and cryptically via permissioned keys) for a given patient nationwide, in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-agnostic manner. The ""on chain"" components for a biopsy could be: Diagnosis, grade, immunophenotype, and molecular features. This no-frills data formatting will aid Health Information Exchange (HIE), especially in making rapid decisions on a new patient or in a frozen section scenario. The metadata benefits for such a national record are limitless (Fig 2). Accessing Anatomical Pathology Lab Information Systems (LIS) nationwide: ""Off chain"" records residing in EHR data lakes, such as the full pathology report, pictures, and Whole Slide Images can be accessed via Blockchain identity authentication tools integrated into surgical pathology LIS. This can facilitate second opinions and extra-institutional consultations through secure interoperability. The ""Pathology"" IOT: Smart contracts have many applications for the pathology lab. Smart cassettes, for example, could alert the lab technician when CAP recommendations for formalin fixation times are not met. Similarly, a set of smart tubes can alert the phlebotomist of a wrong filling order. Also, ""digital wallets"" can be created to track supply stocks and automatically reorder needed materials.

The supply chain of tomorrow will be leaner, faster and most importantly, self-orchestrated. This unprecedented pace of change will be driven by a few radical technologies that will be cautiously adopted by industry participants over the next 15 years.Aim and tasks. The aim of this article to determine the level of implementation of digital technologies in transport industries, identify obstacles to their wide distribution, as well as assess the immediate prospects for the use of electronic document management, web platforms, artificial intelligence, large data in the field of transport and infrastructure.Research results. This new era has seen several technological advances fuse, creating powerful new digital tools that will be used to dramatically reshape industries, including logistics, over the next few years. This slower rate of digital adoption brings enormous risks that, if ignored, could be potentially catastrophic for even the biggest established players in the business. There are benefits of using e-carrier to manage shipments and logistics, such as: easier planning of shipments; save time with web booking of transport; improved workflow with a document management system; direct access to statistics and reports; optimised order management and inventory overview. The purpose of bringing automation to ports and terminals is to introduce a whole new level of consistency when handling cargo, and the results are: reduced labor costs, minimization of human errors and delays, reduced carbon emissions compared to manually operated terminals.Conclusion. The rapid evolution of new technologies and their affordable nature is driving people to adopt them on a massive level, making their lives easier. This forces entities and their ecosystems to transform in order to improve their competitive position and sometimes even to maintain it. Digitalization will help to deliver better business results and to better control trading and operational risks in one place. Timing is, of course, another opportunity as shipping and trading companies need to be able to react much faster today than they did in the past. Cloud technology within the digitalization wave will unleash those opportunities."

Abstract Purpose – The aim is to contribute significantly to the first wave of empirical investigations related to the impact of green supply chain management (GSCM) practices on performance. The paper also aims to theorize and empirically assess a comprehensive GSCM practices and performance model. The model incorporates green supply chain practices that link manufacturers with supply chain partners (both suppliers and customers) to support environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Data collected from 159 manufacturing managers were analyzed using a structural equation modeling methodology. Manufacturing managers provide data reflecting the degree to which their organizations work with suppliers and customers to improve environmental sustainability of the supply chain. Findings – Generally, the adoption of GSCM practices by manufacturing organizations leads to improved environmental performance and economic performance, which, in turn, positively impact operational performance. Operational performance enhances organizational performance. Research limitations/implications – As a first wave empirical investigation of the impact of GSCM practices on performance, the study is by necessity exploratory. Practical implications – Practitioners are provided with a framework for assessing the synergistic impact of GSCM practices on performance. Internal environmental management and green information systems are identified as necessary precursors to the implementation of green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design, and investment recovery. Originality/value – A comprehensive GSCM practices performance model is proposed and empirically assessed. The results of this investigation support the proposition that GSCM practices are both environmentally necessary and good business. A structured two-wave approach to the implementation of GSCM practices is recommended."

However, the industry as a whole may not be equipped to handle the changes brought on by new technology: with affordable home recording equipment, independent artists can release music directly to online platforms; with streaming services, massive per-play consumption reports are generated daily; and with low artist payments reflecting consumer expectations that music should be free, there is growing pressure for the industry to be more transparent with royalty calculations and faster with their payments. In this paper, we describe the state of the global music industry today, and present historical and systemic factors which have led to the industry’s lack of transparency and complexity. We summarize the primary copyrights and licenses involved in music, and present a simplified value web as a basis for future research into possible global solutions. We identify three process layers for infrastructure related to managing assets, rights, reporting, and payments, regardless of physical format: (1) rights ownership, (2) consumption data, and (3) payment systems. Focusing on rights ownership, we summarize the major issues with today’s infrastructure, metadata, and protocols, highlighting causes for industry “black boxes,” the blockages in the system causing creators’ royalty payments to get stuck in the system. Finally, we look at past collaborative initiatives, primarily the Global Repertoire Database (GRD), in order to gain key learnings, and we acknowledge nascent blockchain-related efforts. With the digital music industry thus synthesized, we outline further research to arrive at a future industry architecture and to understand the impacts of the likely music supply chain transformation, and the related managerial implications."

Such behavior exists in biological systems, physical systems as well as in the human performance. It is an inherited nature of a System-of-Systems (SoS). A suitable framework is needed to guide the development of SoS architecture, which includes emergent behavior. Enterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline driving change within organizations. Aligning and integrating business and IT thereby belongs to strategic management. The management of EA change is a challenging task for enterprise architects, due to complex dependencies amongst EA models, when evolving towards different alternatives. In this paper, various architecture frameworks are explored for an application on SoS architecture: the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) and Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF) are declared inappropriate. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF) and the Zachman Framework on the other hand are suitable. The use of Zachman Framework to guide the architecture development is described in step-by-step details in this paper. The agent-based simulation is recommended to develop the SoS architectural models following the Zachman Framework guidance. Ultimately, SysML and UML should be integrated with the agent-based model.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to evaluate inventory management in the private healthcare sector in Malaysia, with a particular focus on the distribution of medicines from a wholesaler to clinics. Currently, there are issues with service levels to clinics that need addressing. Design/methodology/approach – The paper adopts a case study approach, with data collected through process mapping, interviews and data analysis. Data flow diagrams are used to visualise the organization's supply chain current and future process. Interviews are used to identify the main supply chain issues, with triangulation of these opinions through data analysis. Findings – The findings identify two main issues within the case study company – urgent orders and stock availability at the wholesaler. From this, a future state design of the supply chain is proposed, based around vendor-managed inventory. Barriers to achieving this are also identified, including consideration of current supply chain management capabilities in Malaysia. Research limitations/implications – Only a single case study supply chain is studied, although two echelons are investigated. While this may limit the generalisation of the findings, there is value in demonstrating the benefits modern supply chain management techniques can bring to developing world healthcare supply chains. Practical implications – The paper shows that modern supply chain management techniques can bring benefits to healthcare supply chains in developing countries. Originality/value – The value of the paper arises from providing a detailed analysis of a healthcare supply chain in the developing world. There have been only a small number of other studies published in the literature."

Abstract Purpose – Recently, in response to the credit crunch and the increased costs of financing, new solutions for supporting the financial management of supply chains, known as supply chain finance (SCF), have been developed. They exploit the strengths of supply chain links to optimise working capital. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference framework that links together the objectives leading to the adoption of SCF solutions and several moderating variables. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a multiple case study methodology, analysing 14 cases of the application of SCF solutions among Italian companies. Findings – The main findings are the identification of the different objectives leading to the adoption of SCF; the analysis of the impact of moderating variables (the level of inter-and intra-firm collaboration, the level of the trade process digitalisation and the bargaining power and financial strength of the leading firm) on SCF adoption; and the formulation of a reference framework supporting the effective adoption of SCF solutions. Research limitations/implications – This contribution is exploratory in nature; theory-testing contributions should be the focus of further research. Also, the sample is limited to Italian companies. Finally, the service provider's point of view has been marginally taken into consideration in this study. Originality/value – The article addresses the need for more empirical research on SCF. It provides a reference framework focused on the objectives and moderating variables leading to effective SCF adoption, providing a theory-building contribution on the general topic of SCF and on the specific topic of the adoption process of different SCF solutions."

These loops are used in many applications to stabilise the signal level in a transceiver chain. In a wireless frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar receiver for example, it is desired to maintain a constant baseband signal level at the receiver output prior to the analogue-to-digital converter. Due to the AGC loop feedback action, the accuracy of this output level directly depends on the detector accuracy. In this study, a detector design employing inherent cancellation of process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations without the need for any complex compensation schemes is proposed. Measurement results of a fabricated test chip are in good agreement with simulations achieving ±0.15 dB accuracy over temperature, supply and part-to-part variations. The fabricated detector prototype on an IBM 0.18 μm technology has an active area of 0.05 mm2 and draws 1 mA from a 3 V supply. An integrated AGC loop including the proposed detector achieves a 52 dB dynamic range consuming an overall 9 mW power.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this research is to examine the causal linkages among supply chain management (SCM) practice, competition capability, the level of supply chain (SC) integration, and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach – This is helpful in developing a framework for linking a firm's SC integration strategy to its competitive strategy, and in identifying how such a linkage can be connected to the improvement of organizational performance. Such effort also should enable us to derive a set of recommended strategies of SCM practices for SC integration. Findings – From the results of LISREL analysis on small and large manufacturing firms, this paper finds that, in small firms, efficient SC integration may play a more critical role for sustainable performance improvement, while, in large firms, the close interrelationship between the level of SCM practices and competition capability may have more significant effect on performance improvement. It is concluded that, in early stage, the emphasis on systemic SC integration may be more crucial. Once SC integration has been implemented, it may be advisable to focus on SCM practice and competition capability. Orginality/value – Attempts to show how the potential benefits of integrating supply chain can no longer be ignored."

Recent European studies have shown that there are a growing number open access monograph publishers, many of which can be described as New University Presses (NUPs) or Academic-Led Publishing (ALP) initiatives, in addition to other small open access presses. The majority of these presses publish open access e-books and also print-on-demand copies for sale. Key studies have shown a positive impact on the usage and discovery of open access books. Despite this evidence, NUPs, ALPs and open access presses in general, have difficulty in accessing the library supply chain - the channels that library acquisition departments use to buy print and e-book content via approved library suppliers, such as Dawson, Askews, ProQuest and EBSCO. This was evidenced in a 2017 landscape report from Jisc, Changing publishing ecologies: A landscape study of new university presses and academic-led publishing. As part of the ALP interviews for the study Rupert Gatti of Open Book Publishers noted that it would be helpful to have a service that “looks at how to bring academic content into the catalogues and the digital learning environments of the universities and to allow universities to also relate back to the publisher, so that there is a flow of information going back both ways”.As such, the Jisc report made a number of recommendations, including best practice in metadata and support with distribution/dissemination. In order to take these recommendations further, Jisc held a community workshop in July 2018 to surface issues with key stakeholders for the following problem statement:“OA publishers have difficulty accessing the channels that library acquisition departments use to buy print and e-book content”.The workshop brought together experts from NUPs, ALPs, book suppliers and distributors, metadata suppliers, libraries and other experts in OA publishing to discuss the above statement. The core aim of the workshop was to allow the experts to share their experiences and knowledge in order to get a better understanding of the supply chain and to gain insight into the problem statement. These discussions highlighted four key areas, which the group agreed needed further development. These have been captured as a set of recommendations and suggestions for best practice.This paper will introduce the ideas behind the workshop, before detailing the outcomes of the discussion sessions, which featured four round table sessions led by a NUP, an ALP, a book supplier and a library.

Some of the economics of the dispersed vision are explored, and perspectives are presented on both the choice of homogeneous universal power quality upstream in the electricity supply chain and on the extremely heterogeneous requirements of end-use loads. It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid. Finally, the potential role of microgrids in delivering heterogeneous power quality is demonstrated by reference to two ongoing microgrid tests in the U.S. and Japan."

In order to understand how we can create futures that do not exclude, isolate, or exploit, we have to understand how the future is written in the present. By considering three key domains, the social, the spatial, and the temporal, there are some ways in which we may be able to see the future as being unequally distributed in the present. The rural-urban divide is one spatial axis that highlights differences that are apparent across potential elements of the future. New modes of transportation, such as car clubs or Uber, are increasingly available in cities but have little reach into rural areas. And expansion into rural areas is questionable, highlighting how different futures may emerge as a result of location. Short-term events and disruptions such as blackouts and supply-chain disruptions offer insight into more precarious unstable futures, as increasing energy consumption and aging infrastructure mean that energy supply systems become progressively overloaded. Tim Jackson in Prosperity Without Growth suggests a vision of the future in which worth and meaning might be seen as something to be obtained through work rather than purchased from the proceeds of work. This may, however, need to be partly obtained through the automation of drudgery. Creating a movement that is both digital and physical shows how those who have an unequal footing in certain structures are changing their position and getting others to change as well. In order for injustices to be remedied in the future, they must be addressed now."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review the green manufacturing and similar frameworks in order to trace the origin, definitions, scope, similarities, differences, and publications of these manufacturing frameworks. Design/methodology/approach – A review of 113 research articles is conducted for various terms, namely, green manufacturing (GM); environmentally conscious manufacturing; environmentally responsible manufacturing; environmentally benign manufacturing; sustainable manufacturing; clean manufacturing; cleaner production; sustainable production with reference to triple bottom line, product life cycle engineering, systems approach, resource and energy efficiency, supply chain, pollution prevention and closed loop system/6R. Findings – It can be said with reasonable confidence that all these eight frameworks have been used interchangeably by researchers but it requires some standardization. It has been observed during literature review that to standardize the terminology researchers have to clear emphatically in their research the use of various life cycle engineering approach; clarity on the end-of-life strategies used; clarity in use of various components of triple bottom line perspectives; inclusion of the whole supply chain and integration of environmental improvement strategies with the business strategy. Research limitations/implications – The literature reviewed for the study is the literature available online using Google scholar. Originality/value – This is one of the first known studies to review the GM and similar frameworks for their origin, definition, scope, similarities, and differences."

Whereas these two innovations have been considered compatible, their practical combination has been mainly anecdotal. The Netherlands was the locale of this study, where both SCM and BIM have been popular approaches. The research objective is to explore their real-world combination and propose strategies for the alignment of SCM and BIM, by viewing Supply Chain (SC) partnering as the inter-organisational proxy of SCM. The main question is: How to align the SCM philosophy with BIM technologies to achieve integration in the construction industry? What aspects contribute to this alignment?. The methodology was mixed and both qualitative and quantitative data were analysed. The overarching method was case study research and the unit of analysis was the firm, also referred to as actor. After a semi-chronological review of the relevant literature, the two constructs of SCM and BIM were found interdependent in product-, process-, and actor-related (P/P/A) dimensions. The study consisted of four other consecutive studies. First, empirical insights into the practical implementation of SC partnering and BIM were obtained via the exploration of five cases. Second, a conceptual model for the quantitative analysis of the product-, process-, and actor-related dimensions was designed. Third, this model and mixed methods were applied to two polar (extreme) cases to analyse the contractual (typically SC-related), digital (typically BIM-related), and informal interactions among the involved actors. Fourth, an additional theoretical exploration of the BIM-enabled SC partnerships took place with focusing also on intra-organisational relations within the involved firms. After the four studies, the findings were systematically combined to create the theoretical synthesis, i.e. generate theory. Three consecutive steps of construct, internal, and external validity took place after the synthesis, to define the transferability of findings. The systematic combination of findings deduced two routes to achieve SC integration in construction: (a) product-related (emphasis on BIM tools), and (b) actor-related (emphasis on SCM philosophy). The two observed routes to SC integration emerged from the data of the polar cases. Two complementary sets of strategies for SC integration were derived afterwards. These strategies could ease the identification of which route is the closest fit to SC integration, and then support the decision-making of how to pursue it. As the concept of BIM is currently a hot topic, it might be wise to undertake a product-related route to integration and gradually introduce strategies from the actor-related route. However, the actor-related route could attain long-term integration and thus, long-lasting relations among the multi-actor networks. The key aspects of the alignment of partnering with construction IT for BIM-enabled SC partnerships are: - The identification of whether the SC complexity is of process-, product- or actor-related nature; - The deployed BIM collaboration patterns, i.e. ad-hoc, linear or distributed; - The SC coordination mechanisms, e.g. centralised or decentralised; - The relation between formal and informal aspects, e.g. symmetric or asymmetric; - The emerging intra-organisational relations due to BIM and SCM implementation; - The hierarchical level that BIM-enabled SC partnership decision-making pertains. As the construction industry evolves into an information-driven sector, the alignment of construction IT with inter-organisational management is preeminent for managing the inherent complexities of the industry. In parallel, embracing inter-organisational approaches for information management such as BIM is a promisingway forward for SCM and construction management."

We have partnered to publish a report for the maritime industry, in which we look at current trends through the lens of global startups . These findings are flanked by a ‘digital 2030 vision’ for the shipping industry, in which Danish Ship Finance presents possible future directions for the industry . The report is structured in three chapters: • Industry innovation outlines our findings from the global startup scene . • Industry transformation explores how new business models will begin to transform value creation in the shipping industry . • Industry redefined weaves these elements together to formulate how value creation across the supply chain may be redefined. Many players within the established global maritime ecosystem are working to digitalise parts of the operation by introducing new technologies to existing business models . We have chosen to look outside the more established part of the industry and have identified 160 startups from the wider global startup scene, in the hope of finding the first hint of new frontiers of digital innovation in the maritime sector . Our conclusion is unequivocal: digital adaptation in the industry is taking off dramatically in 2018. When we compare the digitalisation journey of the shipping industry with that of other industries that have progressed further, we appear to be close to an inflection point. We expect that the shipping industry’s adaptation to new technologies and new business models will intensify strongly within the next five years – maybe even sooner . In our digital 2030 vision, we conclude that some of the basic mechanisms for value creation in the shipping industry could be redefined within the next ten to 15 years, even though most of the startups we have analysed are enablers of innovation, rather than disruptors of the traditional maritime players’ . We outline three business models that may have a major impact on the shipping industry: value beyond the vessel, reinventing the operating model and traditional business models . Some of these will play out, while others will be overtaken by alternative scenarios or the status quo will prevail longer than expected . Even so, we urge our readers to consider some of the structural challenges that we believe are transforming the long-term outlook for value creation in many parts of the shipping industry."

The results highlight the considerable barriers to transferring AM technology to engineering applications. However, there is an untapped potential for manufacturing applications in small-series and pre-series production at the product refinement stages. Furthermore, future projections of AM production throughput and cost reductions will disrupt organisational supply chains. This will lead organisations to create faster design, development and manufacturing cycles, unlocking novel applications and introducing new possibilities to change product architecture at any stage of the product development while compressing the supply chain and allowing for quick responses to changing customer demands"

There are a variety of sensors that help track the location, identity, activity and behavior of people. Solutions based on these technologies can be seamlessly integrated with the existing store ecosystem of short range wireless communication such as Wi-Fi networks and Near Field Communication (NFC). Embedded sensors provide contextual intelligence in real time and also help improve operational efficiencies by bringing transparency to existing processes. The applications for Industrial Internet of things in Retail (IIoT-R) can be classified into two broad categories – driving efficiencies across supply chain and store operations and improving customer experience.

The imagery processing chain was executed with four different software packages. In all cases the Rational Polynomial Functions (RPFs) orientation model was used, with rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) supplied by the vendors. The accuracies of the extracted DSMs were compared with the public light detection and ranging (lidar) DSM. The DSM extracted with each software package was used to generate the corresponding orthophoto. The orthophoto accuracy was assessed against 1:5000/1:10000 maps. The results obtained show that ZY-3 imagery allow us to generate DSMs with an accuracy, in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), which can reach 1.5–4.2 m in the flat area, 3.9–6.9 in the urban area, and 5.7–8.2 m in the mountain area.

On the other side, we are witnessing new developments in logistics service providers and their transformation. Competitiveness today doesn’t depend only on price but also on customer service and delivery time. This can be influenced by the implementation of modern methods in logistics. Thus, logistics service providers in the global market are looked at as business partners and the relationship with logistics service company is considered as a partnership. Because of the development in technology e-logistics concept has become more frequently used since it gives concepts for information sharing and information transparency within partners within supply chains. Thus, one of the important tasks of e-logistics is to share information with its partners and with that, it can have an influence on their competitiveness. The main aim of the paper is to show that the right logistics service provider in the modern supply chain can help companies to gain and maintain competitiveness and especially by using different modern digital tools in doing business. Methods: Paper has been written based on the analyses of the reviewed literature together with determining potential influence e-logistics and e-SCM have on company’s competitiveness. The case of DHL included in this study has been selected to present potentials which e-logistics have on creating a competitive advantage. Results: Research results show that use of advanced logistics operator can help companies in increasing their competitiveness in today’s market Conclusions: Customer experience, new entrants, technology collaboration vs. competition are major characteristics of the new trend and logistics service providers will need to adapt to these changes. Improved running in one of the previously mentioned areas will create and maintain the company’s competitiveness and as more modern technological tools and solutions will be used, companies will be able to have more benefits. © Wyższa Szkoła Logistyki, Poznań, Polska."

The market is primarily concerned about the ability of the Apple supply chain to meet the iPhone X demands. Therefore, demand may weaken owing to excessive high selling prices, which may have a spillover effect on the overall semiconductor industry's production chain. • Mergers and Acquistions: In view of the digital transformation need for artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, automotive electronics, and data analysis, mergers and acquisitions gain momentum in the world of abundant capital. Therefore, the worldwide semiconductor industry still has an opportunity to see mergers and acquisitions to acquire new technologies and capture new markets. Meanwhile, Chinese semiconductor firms, private equity funds and semiconductor companies seeking digital transformation will complete major mergers and acquisitions in 2018. The motives include nothing more than acquiring new technologies and expanding market share, customers, products and services, digital strategies, and talented workers. • Operating Performance: Of all firms within the industry, Siliconware Precision Industries Corporation Limited witnessed a decline in the revenue in January 2018, while the remaining ones, especially Nanya Technology Corporation, Winbond Electronics Corporation, Macronix International Corporation Limited, Powerchip Technology Corporation, Powertech Technology Inc. saw growth owing to a lower baseline in January 2017 and a steady increase in the prices of memory. The revenue of Nanya Technology Corporation hit a record high in 11 years, thanks to a steady rise in the prices of DRAM and the development of 20nm process which boosted sales volume. • Global Sales of Semiconductor Equipment: The global sales of semiconductor will ease to 7.5 percent in 2018 from a 35.6 percent growth in 2017. South Korea and Taiwan will see declines of 5.6 percent and 10.9 percent from a year earlier, respectively, suggesting that the peak for equipment purchase for the memory and foundry sectors became a thing of the past. However, China's sales rose 49.3 percent, the world's second largest market for semiconductor equipment, followed by Taiwan, ranked number 3. This suggests that South Korea and China will overtake Taiwan in 2018. • Industry Outlook: Although the memory market in 2018 will not be as strong as in 2017, sales value of domestic memory will grow owing to an increase in the production. Moreover, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited would secure orders for Apple's 7nm process-driven A12 application processor and orders for smartphone chips from Hisili, a subsidiary of Huawei, orders for GPU chips from Nvidia, orders for FPGA chips form Xilinx and orders for Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 mobile phone chips and modems. All will contribute to boost foundry sales. Moreover, sales of semiconductor packaging and testing will grow marginally, thanks to an increase in demand for the versatility, high efficiency of the terminal products and the high demand for chip integration. This will result in the rise of wafer-level heterogeneous integrated packaging technologies, such as fan-out packages and 2.5D package with imbedded interposer. Therefore, total sales of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing industry will grow by a single-digit figure in 2018 from a year earlier. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

However, on the information side, the gap between real and digital retail is still far from being bridged. This article will present the emerging technologies for customer behavior analysis in traditional retail, which will allow in the coming years to reach the same wealth of information that now is available only in the digital world."

This study presents a thermo-fluid dynamic model of a single mango fruit to better understand the convective cooling behavior of fruits with more complex, non-spherical shapes and a heterogeneous composition.

The accuracy of airflow modeling and of applying a realistic fruit shape are assessed. It is quantified how much higher airspeeds lead to faster cooling of the pulp and seed, and how strong non-uniform temperature heterogeneities are inside the fruit. From sensitivity analysis, air temperature has the most impact on fruit temperature during cooling, while thermal properties and fruit size have a minor influence. The evolution of the quality attributes is shown at different temperatures, and the heterogeneities in quality within the mango fruit are also investigated.

Ongoing transformations in industry and production activities are unprecedented in terms of their scale and impact. Emerging technological developments are likely to bring widespread automation and irreversible shifts in the structure of jobs, raising major challenges on labor markets and for policymakers responsible for promoting the necessary skills and employment. Labor and technology have long nurtured a close and mutually beneficial relationship [Keynes, 1930]. While technological change has helped improve labor productivity and has been therefore translated at the firm-and macro-levels into economic growth and job creation, new technologies have substituted labor in many industries and occupations, displacing jobs across sectors, regions, or trades. Capitalization effects have benefited the sectors and enterprises in transition, as well as related sectors and partner firms that have captured positive spill-overs through pervasive supply chains. However, at the same time, destructive effects have disproportionately hit industries, territories, and populations that demonstrated a deficit of skills or lag behind the digital transition. Our world is going through a deep digital transformation. The Internet of Things (IoT), i.e., the connection of all kinds of devices, objects, and sensors via the Internet, is mutating into a gigantic, powerful and hyper-responsive ""superorganism"" that can monitor, inform, manage operations, and take action in real-time without the active involvement of individuals, furthermore generating an unprecedented volume of data [OECD, 2015a]. Combined with big data analytics and the storage capacity of cloud computing, the IoT can empower new predictive approaches to decision-making, new business models, intelligent systems, and fully autonomous machines [OECD, 2016]. Applications are spreading rapidly with tremendous repercussions to be expected across a large range of sectors. The IoT in particular enables smart manufacturing by providing data and tools for improving factory operations and better managing risk in the supply chain from product logistics to inventory management to machine maintenance. In network industries, IoT-enabled smart grids allow for monitoring traffic, emergencies, infrastructure usage, cutting power outages, reducing waste, and implementing smart pricing programs. Abstract T he introductory article to the special issue ""Labour Market in the Context of Technological Transformations"" presents an overall picture of the latest technological trends altogether referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), their impact on the changing structure of the labour market, the demand for prospective skills, as well as emerging policy challenges. The author concludes that ensuring the resilience, adaptability and efficiency of labour markets are therefore not only a matter of addressing the skills needs of the Next Production Revolution, but also a prerequisite to social stability and cohesion."

Firstly, the characteristics of agricultural product supply chain and system requirements were analyzed. The system adopted the architecture of multi-layer distributed system. The whole system could be divided into 6 layers including user layer, interface layer, application layer, support service layer, data layer and equipment layer. Secondly, according to the actual needs of the system, the paper illustrated business process of agricultural product supply chain.

The system could be divided into 5 subsystems which included register, production, enterprise management, government supervision and traceability subsystem. Database was the basic part of the system.

The QR(quick response) code was the most important part in the whole system. In order to expound the process that QR code was generated, a lot of work needed to be done. Under the guidance of HACCP(hazard analysis and critical control point) management system, and after analysis on possible dangers of the agricultural product supply chain, the paper described key factors affecting the quality and safety of agricultural products, and then encoding objects were identified. These encoding objects referred to the origin of agricultural products, product registration number, production batch and harvest batch. Based on certain rules about agricultural product encoding, each encoding object corresponded to a series of numbers. After the digital information was transformed into graphic information, the QR code came out. Each user could scan QR code through a mobile phone or computer to obtain detailed information on agricultural products. System implementation used the popular B/S architecture, took the HighCharts and jQuery as front frames; and with the help of the AJAX(asynchronous JavaScript and XML) asynchronous interaction and JSON(JavaScript object notation) data transmission technologies, this system could be successfully realized. Finally, the article showed the interfaces of some functional modules to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system. The system realizes the agricultural products whole supply chain of the entire process of tracking and tracing which was from the planting, harvesting and processing to the sales. The government management department could realize the on-line office work and improve the supervision efficiency through this system. Agricultural product production and management enterprises could standardize the production operation process, and improve the production management efficiency. Consumers could obtain product information through computers, mobile phones and so forth. If there was a problem of agricultural product quality and safety, consumers could protect their legitimate rights through legal channels. Development of agricultural products quality and safety traceability system was a cooperative project which was designed by Hefei University of Technology and Jiangyin Inspection and Testing Center of Agricultural Products Quality and Security. After expert evaluation, the system has passed the project acceptance."

Abstract Purpose – The objective of this exploratory paper is to find out what is important to consider when developing a supply chain in health care, what is required in order to establish a supply chain orientation and how lean and agile can be used as process strategies in order to improve supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – In order to build an empirical framework for using both lean and agile strategies in health care supply chain management illustrative examples are provided from a Swedish health care setting describing the patient flow and planning processes. Findings – Supply chain management has potential to work well as a philosophy for patient flow in the health care sector. However, it should not only be about the use of the concept of lean in health care, as in fact is the case in practice today. It is rather about organizing for quick response and flexibility in a hybrid strategy through combining lean and agile process strategies. This can only be done if a systems approach is applied together with a strategic orientation, where cooperative efforts by the supply chain members should synchronize and converge operational as well as strategic capabilities into a unified whole. Practical implications – The analysis in the paper underlines the importance of focusing on both agility and leanness combined. Hospitals or health care systems that introduce such an approach, as opposed to only relying on lean strategies, could gain both competitive advantages and improved performance. Originality/value – In health care, even more so than in the manufacturing industry, containment of costs without sacrificing quality is important. This paper applies SCM techniques, tools and concepts that have not been used previously for patient flow in a health care setting, combining lean and agile in one and the same analysis."

Abstract Purpose – Improvement of reverse supply chains requires accurate and timely information about the patterns of consumption. In the consumer context, the ways to generate and access such use-visibility data are in their infancy. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how the Internet of Things (IoT) may be operationalised in the domestic setting to capture data on a consumer's use of products and the implications for reverse supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses an explorative case approach drawing on data from studies of six UK households. "" Horizontal "" data, which reveals patterns in consumers' use processes, is generated by combining "" vertical "" data from multiple sources. Use processes in the homes are mapped using IDEF0 and illustrated with the data. The quantitative data are generated using wireless sensors in the home, and qualitative data are drawn from online calendars, social media, interviews and ethnography. Findings – The study proposes four generic measurement categories for operationalising the concept of use-visibility: experience, consumption, interaction and depletion, which together address the use of different household resources. The explorative case demonstrates how these measures can be operationalised to achieve visibility of the context of use in the home. The potential of such use-visibility for reverse supply chains is discussed. Research limitations/implications – This explorative case study is based on an in-depth study of the bathroom which illustrates the application of use-visibility measures (UVMs) but provides a limited use context. Further research is needed from a wider set of homes and a wider set of use processes and contexts. Practical implications – The case demonstrates the operationalisation of the combination of data from different sources and helps answer questions of "" why? "" , "" how? "" , "" when? "" and "" how much? "" , which can inform reverse supply chains. The four UVMs can be operationalised in a way that can contribute to supply chain visibility, providing accurate and timely information of consumption, optimising resource use and eliminating waste. Originality/value – IDEF0 framework and case analysis is used to identify and validate four UVMs available through IoT data – that of experience, consumption, interaction and depletion. The UVMs characterise IoT data generated from a given process and inform the primary reverse flow in the future supply chain. They provide the basis for future data collection and development of theory around their effect on reverse supply chain efficiency."

As firms become more innovative in their technical infrastructures and more competitive in their respective industries/verticals, their extended enterprise models include using their previous enterprise resource planning (ERP) investments as foundations for prioritizing additions and for longer-term strategies. The key issue for many firms is how to leverage their ERP implementation to become better partners and collaborators by enabling digital options to exploit business opportunities. This paper ascertains the contextual conditions under which ERP system implementations have the greatest impact on intention to adopt digital options. Using empirical data, it finds that the impact of ERP implementation on digital-options adoption intention is moderated by a firm's digital-resource readiness. For information systems (IS) practice, the study suggests that firms should view ERP divisibility as an option value generator for supporting new customers and revenue opportunities. For IS research, it relates digital-options theory to specific measurable constructs and to the firm's digital-resource readiness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2009 M.E.

If airports wish to remain relevant and profitable in the future, their ability to innovate is vital. Every day, airports have to perform a delicate balancing act between short-term activities and long-term initiatives. Moreover, the uncertainty that the future brings will require substantial courage and adaptability.This paper discusses how Amsterdam Airport Schiphol strives to optimise flexibility, control and collaboration: ensuring we are flexible enough to anticipate and adapt to future developments, gaining more control by assuming the role as orchestrator in relation to the complete customer journey and supply-chain process and work in strong collaboration with current and future business partners.The paper analyses how the customer is the central focus of everything Schiphol does: we make the passengers’ time valuable while we connect their world. Schiphol is preparing itself to embark upon new types of partnerships and revenue models.

The use of TEP-based AFS can minimize large timing margin which is added to a clock cycle time for tolerating process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. On an FPGA, in general, the typical dynamic frequency scaling has used the feature of dynamic frequency synthesis (DFS) in a digital clock manager (DCM). However, it has a long locking time. Moreover, during the DCM reconfiguration for generating a new frequency, the lock signal of the DCM can be lost and it leads to possible glitches or spikes at the output. In this work, a variable-length ring oscillator (VLRO), which employs a high-speed carry chain in an FPGA, is proposed to replace the DCM for changing the frequency within one clock cycle without introducing any glitches. Furthermore, an in-situ TEP, which detects timing errors, is combined with VLRO to further reduce the timing margin of a target system. Our proposed in-situ TEP-based AFS scheme is applied to a 16×16-bit multiplier and implemented on a Spartan-6 FPGA device (XFC6SLX45). The functional correctness of the TEP is verified under various DC supply voltages and operating frequencies. The experimental results show that the proposed TEP-based AFS system switches the clock frequency correctly within two clock cycles and improves circuit performance up to 1.62×at the nominal operating condition by minimizing the timing margin."

This reality has been brought into sharp focus by the seemingly limitless creativity that the Internet has unleashed. Much of this creativity occurs without reference to the incentive structure provided by copyright law and demonstrates the potential redundancy of several existing industry functions. The result has been a seemingly intractable tension between established industries and emergent modes of production and dissemination. The clearest examples of this tension are the current debates over the utility of peer-to-peer technology and the competition between proprietary and open source software development models. This tension, and the realities of creativity that underpin it are the subject of this paper. A diverse range of creative experiments facilitated by digital networked technology is considered and used as a backdrop to a general discussion on some of the areas where reforms to copyright's existing incentive structure are most needed."

Several agencies, such as the Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies (CSIP) strive to educate consumers about the need to verify these websites before purchasing their pharmaceuticals. The debate continues about whether consumers will authenticate the pharmaceutical product that arrives from the online pharmacy--a holographic image can be affixed to pharmaceutical packaging that just requires the sun to reveal the dual color images. The discussion in this article centers on illustrating the size and growth of illegitimate pharmaceuticals; debating the ability to measure harm to unsuspecting consumers; describing supply chain vulnerability and the criminal groups involved in pharmaceutical crime; highlighting the enormous profitability of the illicit trade; and concluding with a few anti counterfeiting tactics designed to thwart the problem.

Food, culture and fashion are among the elements that characterize Italy in the world. The Mediterranean diet, its products and its dishes are imitated in every part of the globe with ""Italian sounding"" products. The economic data for 2017 show that the PDO and PGI production in Italy have a value of 15.2 billion euro, equal to 18% of the total turnover of the national agri-food sector. On the export front, the Made in Italy quality production continues to grow, reaching euro 8.8 billion in 2017, accounting for 21% of Italian agri-food exports. The complexity and the value of the agri-food chain are the reasons behind the technology sector, and in particular of blockchain-based projects. The focus on the food market must be sought in the challenges it faces such as the fight against fraud and counterfeiting, food security and the redistribution of value along the supply chain. It is not only the need for transparency, however, that makes the agri-food sector an ideal ally of blockchain technology. Historically, the food production sector and, in particular, agricultural products, have been characterized by the presence of small and medium-sized producers, characterized by their low bargaining power. Within this context, the blockchain can play a leading role in the exchange of goods and services that make it possible to democratize the supply process, making the relationship between small farmers and big buyers fairer. The main elements that motivated the research on the Blockchian Partenership Iinitiative were to reduce the information asymmetry, trying to decrease the distance between producers and consumers, and making the ""value"" of the suppli chain of quality products PDO quality and PGI through the Distributed Ledger Technologies, therefore in the supply chain there are some phases of the process that are not officially codified, which represent a gap to be filled to protect the consumer."

This applies more or less for both types of establishments, large as well as small and medium-sized ones (SMEs) in all of the three investigated industries (manufacturing, retail/wholesale and banking/insurance). Although a kind of E-Commerce maturity is observable, statements about the de facto usage behavior and intensity cannot be made based on the underlying survey data. In contrast to the results of the global survey, German firms less often regarded E-Commerce as an enabler for entering new markets or increasing sales at an international level. Given the existing global market orientation, German firms were already acting competitively in international markets, even in the pre-E-Commerce era. After E-Commerce solutions proved successful, SMEs were at the forefront, implementing E-Commerce applications and are therefore important drivers of innovation diffusion in Germany. Although all industry sectors are well equipped, industry-related differences remain. The manufacturing industry started from a high level of existing advanced digital technologies such as EDI or joint supply chain management systems. The retail/wholesale industry, with its large number of SMEs, can benefit more from new forms of E-Commerce such as Internet-based EDI. SMEs in this sector are able to improve their business processes more often than SMEs in other sectors where industry-related EDI standards were not in place. The banking and insurance sector heavily invests in online business models. While most benefits of online banking and brokerage appears on the customer side, firms in this sector cannot benefit in the same way. As long as banks are not able to decrease their costs, e.g., by reducing the number of branches, the multi-channel distribution strategy offers limited benefits. The relative efficient usage of E-Commerce seems to depend directly on the strategic focus of firms. While strategically unfocused firms might still be experimenting with E-Commerce applications, others are already gaining benefits from E-Commerce. SMEs as the backbone of German industry are not only able to reach the same stage of diffusion as large firms, but are also able to achieve commercial success. Especially in the retail/wholesale industry, SMEs may benefit for the first time from decreasing costs due to supply chain improvements and electronic transactions. Government and public administration as a public sector cannot be regarded as drivers of E-Commerce in Germany. Far from it, the lack of E-Commerce applications in the public sector makes electronic processes impossible for the private industry sector, resulting in additional manual coordination efforts."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the relationship between product nature and supply chain strategy, by using Fisher's model as the framework. Design/methodology/approach – The research collected quantitative data by conducting a questionnaire-based survey, with a total of 119 respondent organisations (of which 107 were usable), at an adjusted response rate of 8 per cent. The survey results provide the basis for the testing of Fisher's model relating product characteristics to supply chain strategy. Findings – The results indicate that the association between product nature and supply chain strategy as articulated in Fisher's model is not significant. A hybrid strategy (pursuing both efficiency and responsiveness) is found to be employed by most organisations irrespective of the nature of the primary product they supply. Research limitations/implications – The analysis is based on survey responses gathered within the Australian manufacturing industry. The findings of the study have implications for understanding the drivers of supply chain strategy, and how other factors, in addition to product type, influence supply chain positioning. Practical implications – The study identifies additional factors which might be influential in the determination of supply chain strategy. It provides practitioners with guidance in choosing an appropriate strategy to deal with supply chain partners. Originality/value – The contribution of the study lies in extending the body of knowledge of supply chain strategy. It tests an existing framework which has only very limited empirical validation, and provides a broader understanding of the influence of product nature on the choice of supply chain strategy."

This paper outlines participatory research undertaken with smallholder farmers in Fiji and the Solomon Island to assess key postharvest thermal risk factors along four fruit and vegetable supply chains. In seeking to combine diagnostic and educational outcomes, a comparatively novel approach of using digital infrared thermal imaging, laser-point thermometer, micro-temperature sensors and reversible chromatic temperature labels was used to help farmers improve ambient postharvest temperature management. Hand-held infrared thermal imagery proved a useful tool in allowing smallholder farmers to visualise and then explore on-farm postharvest thermal risks factors. To provide farmers with ongoing means for self-assessment and potentially remediate postharvest temperature management practices, low-cost reversible chromatic temperature labels were provided. Adhesive chromatic temperature labels were particularly suited to smallholder farm application as they could be placed throughout the packing shed and on postharvest equipment."

This study proposes a transshipment approach to enable the lateral sharing of perishable materials and optimize material allocation for a contractor’s project portfolio. The transshipment approach includes two main steps. First, the daily material supply and demand data are collected from a continuously updated schedule and three-dimensional models as input for calculating unused material quantities. Second, an evolutionary optimization algorithm is used for optimizing the transshipment quantities with minimal cost. As proof of concept, the proposed transshipment approach is demonstrated by looking at a portfolio of seven building projects managed by the same contractor. The demonstration shows that the allocation of the unused materials helps to avoid waste and reduce costs from over-ordered materials by around 52%. As a result, this also leads to improved coordination between contractors and suppliers and better material flow in construction projects."

While some of this interest has been driven by the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, enterprises are looking to improve trust between counterparties and establish one version of the truth that can be shared among companies, customers, intermediaries, and counterparties. For example, distributed ledgers can establish one version of the truth that can help improve financial transactions processing and improve data flow to help increase revenue and margins for members of product and distribution supply chains. In this white paper, we focus our discussion and analysis on where blockchain and DLT and smart contracts are today and suggest areas of investment for digital transformation. We continue to see increased investment in blockchain solutions and interest from both business and technology managers. In this white paper, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of using DLT and smart contracts in a variety of use cases across several industries. We also provide recommended actions for decision makers evaluating DLT and smart contract use cases, solutions, and deployment options. SITUATION OVERVIEW Blockchain records, called blocks, are entered into a secure blockchain ledger. Using advanced cryptography, when new records are entered into the ledger, cryptographic codes called hashes secure new records and blocks to the ledger resulting in a secure, sequential, and immutable block in a secure chain. After records are entered into the ledger, they are locked in and cannot be altered, creating an immutable record keeping system. When a new record is added or an existing record is updated, a new block is created, and the result is a sequential history of records such as financial transactions and product shipments. When new blocks are added, then the ledger is updated and the most recent version of the ledger becomes the ""latest version of the truth."" For use cases that require one version of the truth, such as financial services and supply chain transaction records, the security and sequential history of the records in a blockchain ledger can be an excellent way to aggregate internal and external data and improve the post-transaction settlement process. Enterprises in multiple industries are looking to improve their business processes and capture the value of blockchain ledgers by distributing (or sharing) access to the blockchain ledger between multiple parties. For example, lines of business within an enterprise can share aggregated blockchain ledgers. A key advantage to DLT is that everyone who is part of a ledger gets an updated version at the same time, providing one version of the truth. Increasingly, enterprises are investing in distributed ledgers to connect themselves to external parties such as suppliers, intermediaries, distribution channels, and customers."

This is reflective both in internal operations and external product delivery. Traditional energy companies are increasingly expanding their product portfolio by integrating elements of digitalization such as data disaggregation and edge intelligence. Similarly, the survey shows a strong correlation between company revenue growth and its approach to IT investments for improving internal operations. The strong adoption of cloud services is in part due to the growing amount of data that companies are dealing with in the energy industry. Smart meters alone generate close to 1.1 billion data points in the U.S. and this is just with a 50% market penetration. Ensuring network stability and dealing with security threats rank as the top two IT challenges facing energy companies today. This is irrespective of company size and region, with the exception of Latin America. Latin American companies ranks security threats as their number one issue. Key drivers for IT investment varies by CIO and CEO. CIOs consider the ability to attract and retain workforce as top driver for IT investments in 2018, where as CEOs consider the ability to boost creativity and innovation as the top reason for IT investments in 2018.Read the full report: http://www.reportlinker.com/p04208138-summary/view-report.htmlAbout Reportlinker ReportLinker is an award-winning market research solution.

This includes the sale of CMOS cellular power amplifier (PA) house Axiom Microdevices to GaAs cellular PA manufacturer Skyworks as well as the emergence from "" stealth mode "" of CMOS cellular PA startups Black Sand Technologies and Javelin Semiconductor. In terms of market share, since TRW Semiconductor paired with RF Micro Devices in the mid-­‐ to-­‐late 1990s, the GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) has been the standard bearer for mobile phone PA performance, cost, and manufacturability. GaAs houses that design, manufacture and package their own PAs and other RF components dominate today's cellular power amplifier market. However, as has been the case in the semiconductor industry since its inception, all roads lead to silicon because it repeatedly proves to offer the optimal combination of performance, cost, functional integration, and manufacturability for digital and analog integrated circuits. Historically, RF circuitry has not been integrated in silicon. However, over the last two decades, the RF transceiver function has joined digital signal processing in silicon-­‐based technologies. As a result, the RF PA and RF front-­‐end system remain the last footholds for GaAs in the modern wireless communications device's signal processing chain. Design of RF front ends into foundry silicon technology would enable the third wave of the fabless revolution, which started with digital ICs, moved to analog, and finally RF/optical components.

Abstract Purpose – Inconsistent research output makes critical literature reviews crucial tools for assessing and developing the knowledge base within a research field. Literature reviews in the field of supply chain management (SCM) are often considerably less stringently presented than other empirical research. Replicability of the research and traceability of the arguments and conclusions call for more transparent and systematic procedures. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the importance of literature reviews in SCM. Design/methodology/approach – Literature reviews are defined as primarily qualitative synthesis. Content analysis is introduced and applied for reviewing 22 literature reviews of seven sub-fields of SCM, published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2009. A descriptive evaluation of the literature body is followed by a content analysis on the basis of a specific pattern of analytic categories derived from a typical research process. Findings – Each paper was assessed for the aim of research, the method of data gathering, the method of data analysis, and quality measures. While some papers provide information on all of these categories, many fail to provide all the information. This questions the quality of the literature review process and the findings presented in respective papers. Research limitations/implications – While 22 literature reviews are taken into account in this paper as the basis of the empirical analysis, this allows for assessing the range of procedures applied in previous literature reviews and for pointing to their strengths and shortcomings. Originality/value – The findings and subsequent methodological discussions aim at providing practical guidance for SCM researchers on how to use content analysis for conducting literature reviews."

In their scheme, a message m is signed by time-stamping a concatena-tion m of the message and the one-time pseudo-random password zt intended to sign messages at a particular time t. The signature is valid only if the time-stamp points to the same time t. Hence, the one time passwords cannot be abused after their use. To efficiently and securely implement such a scheme at the client side, dedicated hardware is needed and thereby, the solutions that save the (secure) memory and computational time are important. For such schemes, the memory consumption directly depends on the efficiency of the hash sequence reversal algorithms. The best known reversal algorithm for the BLT scheme uses O(log 2 memory. This means that for a signing key that is valid for one year (i.e. ≈ 2 25 with one-second time resolution), the device needs to store about 25 2 = 625 hash values which for SHA-256 hashing algorithm means about 20 K bytes of secure memory. Another problem with hash sequence reversal algorithms is that they mostly assume that the signature device is always connected to the computer or has an independent power supply. This is a serious limitation for smart-card implementations of the scheme. We show first that a mini Public Key Infrastructure in the signature device can be used to lower the memory consumption about twice. There is a master key (i.e. a hash sequence) that is used to certify short term (about five minutes) signing keys so that a signature consists of a "" short term certificate "" which is a hash chain in the master hash tree (used to authenticate the master hash sequence), and a hash chain that is used to authenticate a particular hash value zt in the sequence. We also discuss how to implement hash sequence signatures in devices that have no power supply and are not regularly connected to computers, such as smart-cards which are often used as personal digital signature devices. General-purpose cryptographic smart-cards also have many restrictions that limit the use of hash sequence signatures. For example, their hashing speed is relatively low: up to 500 hashing steps per second; their secure memory is of limited size, etc. This all combined with irregular usage patterns makes the use of hash sequence signatures questionable. We show why the hash sequence signature (in its original form) cannot be used as the CA signature in the mini PKI solution. Finally, we propose a new type of hash sequence signature that is more suitable for smart-card imple-mentations."

From conception and design to project completion and ongoing maintenance, all points in the lifecycle of any product involve the work of fluctuating teams of designers, suppliers and customers. That is why companies are involved in the creation of a distributed design and a manufacturing environment which could provide an effective way to communicate and share information throughout the entire enterprise and the supply chain. At present, the technologies that support such a strategy are based on World Wide Web platforms and follow two different paths. The first one focuses on 2D documentation improvement and introduces 3D interactive information in order to add knowledge to drawings. The second one works directly on 3D models and tries to extend the life of 3D data moving these design information downstream through the entire product lifecycle. Unfortunately the actual lack of a unique 3D Web-based standard has stimulated the growing up of many different proprietary and open source standards and, as a consequence, a production of an incompatible information exchange over the WEB.

Abstract Purpose – The objective of this exploratory paper is to find out what is important to consider when developing a supply chain in health care, what is required in order to establish a supply chain orientation and how lean and agile can be used as process strategies in order to improve supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach – In order to build an empirical framework for using both lean and agile strategies in health care supply chain management illustrative examples are provided from a Swedish health care setting describing the patient flow and planning processes. Findings – Supply chain management has potential to work well as a philosophy for patient flow in the health care sector. However, it should not only be about the use of the concept of lean in health care, as in fact is the case in practice today. It is rather about organizing for quick response and flexibility in a hybrid strategy through combining lean and agile process strategies. This can only be done if a systems approach is applied together with a strategic orientation, where cooperative efforts by the supply chain members should synchronize and converge operational as well as strategic capabilities into a unified whole. Practical implications – The analysis in the paper underlines the importance of focusing on both agility and leanness combined. Hospitals or health care systems that introduce such an approach, as opposed to only relying on lean strategies, could gain both competitive advantages and improved performance. Originality/value – In health care, even more so than in the manufacturing industry, containment of costs without sacrificing quality is important. This paper applies SCM techniques, tools and concepts that have not been used previously for patient flow in a health care setting, combining lean and agile in one and the same analysis."

Abstract The supply chain concept aided marketing by highlighting relationships that form a network of firms creating products for consumers. It helped change the focus from individual transactions to a more comprehensive view of the entire system. The value chain concept in marketing extends the supply chain view in an important way: it explicates the value that is created at each stage of the chain. For marketers, it is a vital tool in satisfying consumers – the final part of the value chain. This value chain can be viewed as having two components: the value delivery system and the consumer. This paper explores several approaches to value that are important in the functioning of the value chain. It then delineates three main elements of the value chain and traces them as they apply to services. It then focuses on one of the more complex services, the health care delivery system. It goes on to describe the health care value network and examine the critical factors that affect the success of the health care process. Finally, it delineates several important implications for health care marketers."

Methods: Twelve healthy male adult Beagle dogs were randomly divided into two groups: group A (the control group) and group B (the MSCs arterial perfusion group). ONFH animal models were established by hip dislocation and liquid nitrogen. At the same time, MSCs were obtained, cultured and proliferated. After three weeks, arterial perfusion was performed in all animals. Group B was given 1 ml MSCs (5 × 106-1 × 107/ml), while 0.9 % normal saline was used in group A. After four weeks or eight weeks, the dogs were put to death. The changes of main arteries, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF mRNA and microvessel density (MVD) of ONFH were observed. All the data were analysed by SPSS13.0. Results: In digital subtraction angiography (DSA), after four or eight weeks of treatment, the quantity and diameter of the main arteries of the femoral head in group B were improved, compared to group A (P < 0.05,P < 0.01). Concerning histology and immunohistochemistry, after four or eight weeks of treatment, the expression of VEGF and MVD were significantly higher than that of group A (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). For real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), after four or eight weeks of treatment, the expression of VEGF mRNA in group B was significantly higher than that of group A (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), and after eight weeks of treatment, the expression of VEGF mRNA were significantly higher than that of four-weeks treatment in group A (P <0.01). Conclusions: MSCs arterial perfusion can promote vascular repair and angiogenesis and then improve blood supply and repair of femoral head. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

In large-scale PV generating systems, the DC power supply is generally composed of a large number of PV panels. Hence, losses are caused by differences in the maximum power point at each PV panel. An MPVS has been proposed to address the above mentioned problem. It helps improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency by applying maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control to each group of PV panels. In addition, if a CLMC is used in an MPVS, a high voltage can be output from the AC side and transmission losses can be decreased. However, with this circuit configuration, the current output from the AC side may be unbalanced. Therefore, we propose a method to output balanced current from the AC side, even if the output of the DC power supply is unbalanced.

Blockchains are a type of decentralisation technology that will fundamentally change the way our financial services, industries and government operate. Simply put, decentralisation technology allows assets to be stored in a network of computers accessed via the Internet. An asset can be a gaming token, a concert ticket, an authorship claim on a book or a digital currency like Bitcoin. With decentralisation technology, the owner of an asset has direct control via their password, which is directly linked to the asset. No one can touch it without consent and no one can stop you when you want to transfer the asset. This is a powerful idea: to place your trust in a network and not in a single entity like a government, a bank, or a multinational company. The types of assets that can be stored are limitless: land titles, financial assets, genome information, social graphs and supply chain information. This technology has electrified financial services and the excitement is spreading to other industry verticals such as energy, pharma, automotive and natural resources. Particularly in banking, decentralisation technologies pose significant existential risks as well as opportunities. If individuals can control their assets over a network, do you need a bank account? Banks understand this and are working to develop products and services ahead of this disruption, so they can be one of the winners in a world with decentralisation technologies. With news articles coming out daily on the latest developments in blockchain, it's easy to get overloaded. We have a framework to help you piece the big picture together."

In Sub-Sahara Africa, the technology has started to be adopted in real estate, supply chain, agriculture, and financial sector. Unfortunately, there is a lack of effort in introducing this technology in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this study aims to explore the issues facing electronic healthcare systems in Sub-Sahara Africa taking Tanzania as a case study and introduce blockchain-based solutions for the discovered issues. Methods: The study used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis. Data were collected through interviews, observation and documentary analysis. Interviews were done with the sample size of 50 participants who were selected from groups of healthcare facility leaders, ICT experts, government representatives, doctors, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, accountants, and receptionists. Direct observation and participatory observation were used to assess different electronic healthcare records systems' functions. Moreover, researchers used document analysis to collect data from public records (like policy manuals), personal documents (like incident reports), and physical evidence (like training materials and handbooks). NVivo 11 software was applied in managing and organizing data analysis. Results: Out of 710 healthcare facilities involved in this study, 34.5% fully implemented electronic healthcare records systems and 78% installed Mfumo wa Taarifa za Uendeshaji Huduma za Afya (MTUHA) also known as (District Health Information Software (DHIS) II). The findings showed that the issues facing electronic healthcare records are; difficulties in taking care of the patients' private information, problems in safely sharing medical information between healthcare facilities, bandwidth issues, and improper handling of data integrity. Conclusion: The existing issues facing electronic healthcare records systems can be tackled through blockchain based solutions like self-sovereign identity and sharing and storing patients' medical data securely in blockchain ledgers and interplanetary file system. Therefore, healthcare facilities owners are recommended to use the findings of this study to elucidate the existing issues. In the future, this study will develop the recommended systems for developing countries environment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore reputational risk that are borne in the supply chain and contribute to this contemporary but growing research stream. Design/methodology/approach – First, a theoretical framework is provided to help in the characterisation of reputational risks and how they impact supply chain members that may be multiple tiers away from the manufacturer. Then, semi-structured interviews were conducted with practitioners who were familiar with reputational risks and who were engaging in varying mitigating techniques. Cognitive modelling was utilised to report the findings. Findings – The practitioners in this paper were very familiar with the risks and were active in varying mitigating practices as budgets and resource constraints would allow. The brevity of the risks identified and the significance of specific risks with how they impact a reputation was revealed. Mitigation is an ongoing and haphazard process with very little information available as would be expected with a typical risk management approach. Research limitations/implications – This paper serves to provide practitioners insight into the varying methods used by firms with supply chain members that number in hundreds. Based on our findings, a recommendation was made that utilise corporate social responsibility as a foundation that is proposed to address a number of risks including those related to price, availability and quality. The limits of this work are that it is specific to a select group of practitioners specialised in this area. Although the information is rich, it is not generalisable. Originality/value – This paper makes a significant contribution to the literature by providing insight into the perceptions of practitioners who make decisions on mitigating reputational risks. The results suggest that this is a very new area of management that is striving to find a way to minimise their exposure."

Design/methodology/approach: The article provides a comparative analysis of the scope of application of CESL with that of the Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG). The approach is critical in nature in that it questions the regulation of business-to-business (B2B) transactions under CESL.

The conceptual model of the IoT evolved rapidly from technologies used to track parts in industrial supply chain management to a diverse set of smart technologies. This rapid evolution has merged several conceptually distinct technologies into a single, difficult-to-define concept. A key difficulty is defining what constitutes a “thing.” The term has been used to refer both to the things sensed, such as a star or the contents of a refrigerator, and to the things that do the sensing (devices). We argue that the Internet of Things is better conceptualized as an Internet of Devices (IoD) because devices, not things, act in a digital form and connect to the Internet. Along with the other requirements of an effective IoD, technologists and policy makers must develop standards, network protocols, identity management solutions, and governance for the IoD to address privacy and security challenges a priori rather than retrofitted after the fact. Privacy and security cannot easily be added to a system that is already deployed and established. In this paper, we define the IoT and the IoD and summarize the independent technologies from which they have evolved. We provide a five-stage general policy framework for evaluating privacy and security concerns in the IoD. Our framework seeks to provide a consistent approach to evaluating privacy and security concerns across all IoD technologies while remaining flexible enough to adapt to new technical developments."

The concept of e-Residency is in line with ongoing approaches in the context of Industry 4.0 trying to realise the fusion of the virtual and the real world, i.e. the linkage between internet and manufacturing leading to concepts of smart supply chain management. Industry 4.0 aims to develop cyber-physical systems (CPS) and dynamic production networks in order to develop flexible and open value chains in the manufacturing of complex mass customization products in a small series up to lot size 1. Until now only few research activities have been done concerning business models for Industry 4.0 even though new business models are necessary to deploy and capitalize the benefits and new opportunities of Industry 4.0. First case studies and surveys of companies operating in field of smart production and logistics reveal that new business models are strongly linked to e-business and service design approaches as well as to concepts of network-based and shared economy. The paper addresses the research question how new the concept of e-Residency is linked to new business models for Industry 4.0 and how e-Residency spurs the development of international business models for Industry 4.0, i.e. International Business 4.0. By doing so the paper will present and discuss cases of internationally successful SMEs, i.e. “Hidden Champions”, and their steps toward International Business 4.0."

This 'energy web' will be a smart, interactive, and self-healing electricity delivery system fully capable of supporting the precision power needs of the digital society of the 21st century. The demand side employs billions and ultimately trillions of microprocessor agents negotiating for specialised services on behalf of their owners. The traditional electricity meter will be replaced by a two-way energy/information portal, through which information, power and services can flow. Because of the resulting optimisation opportunities, substantial efficiency gains are possible throughout the entire energy chain, from end user to producer. Another advantage is an improvement in economic productivity through the use of advanced digital technologies in all sectors of the economy. A balanced focus on the technologies of supply and the technol ogies of demand is needed to meet global electrification goals. The paper shows that the sustainable growth of the global economy will be increasingly reliant on 'digital quality' electricity (perfectly reliable and free of spikes, voltage sags and frequency fluctuations) to power computers, advanced electro-technologies for business and industry, the internet and its successor networks, and the knowledge-based industries of the future. Examples include semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, advanced materials, nanotechnology applications and biotechnology. These applications are already well established in the developed world, and they will become increasingly important in the LDCs as these countries seek to expand the technology base of their economies. Finally, the pap er points out that a balanced implementation of the technologies of supply and demand offers an optimal approach to improving worker productivity and thereby addressing the issues of an ageing (and shrinking) work force in many parts of the globe."

Companies such as GE, Lockheed Martin, and BMW are switching to it for industrial production at scale. More companies will follow as the range of printable materials continues to expand. Already available are basic plastics, photosensitive resins, ceramics, cement, glass, numerous metals, thermoplastic composites (some infused with carbon nanotubes and fibers), and even stem cells. In this article the author makes the case that additive manufacturing will gain ground quickly, given advantages such as greater flexibility, fewer assembly steps and other cost savings, and enhanced product-design possibilities. Managers, D’Aveni writes, should now be engaging with strategic questions on three levels: Sellers of tangible products should ask how their offerings could be improved, whether by themselves or by competitors. Industrial enterprises should revisit their operations to determine what network of supply chain assets and what mix of old and new processes will be optimal. And leaders must consider the strategic implications as whole commercial ecosystems begin to form around the new realities of 3-D printing. Many of the biggest players already in the business of additive manufacturing are vying to develop the platforms on which other companies will build and connect. Platform owners will be powerful because production itself is likely to become commoditized over time. Those facilitating connections in the digital ecosystem will sit in the middle of a tremendous volume of industrial transactions, collecting and selling valuable information"

Abstract Purpose – Measuring or monitoring supply chain performance reveals the gap between planning and execution and helps companies to identify potential problems and areas for improvement. However, it is recognized that developing key performance indicators (KPIs), or metrics, is very challenging and a set of practical guidelines is not readily available for companies and supply chain management (SCM) practitioners. This paper seeks to offer a practical approach to performance measurement and to present a list of essential KPIs. Design/methodology/approach – This paper offers insights from industry in the area of supply chain performance measurement and a practical approach to developing performance metrics. Findings – The experience from, and the review of, industry standards and best practices in supply chain performance measurement suggest that "" less is better "" as to developing performance metrics. Companies should focus on only a small list of KPIs which are critical for their operations management, customer service, and financial viability. Potential KPIs should be developed for each of the supply chain operations-reference (SCOR) model's four meta-processes (plan, source, make, and delivery) and need to be hierarchically grouped such as primary and secondary metrics. Practical implications – The paper offers a background of why performance measurement is necessary for SCM success, pragmatic guidelines for designing and implementing performance metrics, and critical KPIs with the definition, examples, and computation mechanism. Originality/value – Despite the importance of performance measurement for successful SCM, many companies wonder how to put performance metrics in place and make them work in practice. This paper offers an industry-oriented, practical approach to performance measurement in SCM contexts and proposes key performance metrics which can be easily adapted for different businesses."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a methodology to identify sustainable supply chain key performance indicators (KPI) that can then be used for sustainability performance evaluation for suppliers. Design/methodology/approach – Initially the complexity of sustainable supply chain performance measurement is discussed. Then, a two-stage method utilizing neighborhood rough set theory to identify KPI and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to benchmark and evaluate relative performance using the KPI is completed. Additional analysis is performed to determine the sensitivity of the KPI set formation and performance results. Findings – The results show that KPI can be determined using neighborhood rough set, and DEA performance results provide insight into relative performance of suppliers. The supply chain sustainability performance results from both the neighborhood rough set and DEA can be quite sensitive parameters selected and sustainability KPI sets that were determined. Research limitations/implications – The data utilized in this study are illustrative and simulated. Only one model for the neighborhood rough set and DEA was utilized. Additional investigations using a variation of rough set and DEA models can be completed. Practical implications – This tool set is valuable for managers to help identify sustainable supply chain KPI (from among hundreds of potential measures) and evaluate sustainability performance of various units within supply chains, including supply chain partners, departments, projects and programs. Social implications – Sustainability incorporates many business, economic and social implications. The methods introduced in this paper can help organizations and their supply chains become more strategically and operationally sustainable. Originality/value – Few tools and techniques exist in the sustainable supply chain literature to help develop KPIs and evaluate sustainability performance of suppliers and the supply chain. This paper is one of the first that integrates neighborhood rough set and DEA to address this important sustainable supply chain performance measurement issue."

Abstract Purpose – Business renovation, the effective utilisation of information technology and the role of business process modelling and simulation, are all vital in supply chain integration projects. This paper aims to show through a combination of these methods how the performance of the supply chain can be improved with the renovation and integration of processes at various tiers in the chain and by the sharing of information between companies. Design/methodology/approach – Simulation-based methodology for measuring the benefits of the creation and renovation of business process models combines the methodology of developing process models and its simulation with the simulation of supply and demand. A procurement process in the oil/retail petrol industry is examined in a case study. Findings – Using the proposed methodology, different business process models can be investigated and simulated. The benefits for each company involved in the presented case are substantial and can be estimated through a simulation. Substantial benefits in costs, quality and lead times were identified, however, their distribution is not symmetric. Inter-organisational IS and applied technology were enablers for supply chain integration. However, organisational changes and new business models were prerequisites for obtaining those benefits. Practical implications – The process approach to supply chain integration presents a mechanism that can be applied to any industry. It represents a systematic methodological business renovation approach involving cost cuts, quality improvements and lead-time improvements. The costs of supply chain integration projects were not studied. The benefits should be measured against the cost of testing the economic feasibility of such projects. Originality/value – The effective utilisation of business process modelling and a simulation of the necessary business renovation are shown. The novel combination of business process and demand/supply simulation enables an estimation of changes in lead-times, process execution costs, quality of the process and inventory costs. Although the methodology is presented through a case study of the oil/retail petrol industry, it can also be used to estimate the benefits and monitor supply chain integration projects in other industries."

Overview In the last few years, blockchain (also known as distributed ledger), the underlying technology of the permissionless or public Bitcoin network, has become very popular for use in private or permissioned environments. Computer companies like IBM and Microsoft, and many key players in different vertical industry segments have recognized the utility of blockchains for securely managing assets (physical/digital) other than cryptocurrencies. IBM did some pioneering work by architecting and implementing a private blockchain system, and then open sourcing it. That system, which has since then been named Fabric, is being enhanced via the Hyperledger Consortium set up under the auspices of the Linux Foundation. Other efforts in the industry include Enterprise Ethereum, R3 Corda and BigchainDB. While currently there is no standard in the blockchain space, all the ongoing efforts involve some combination of database, transaction, encryption, virtualization, consensus and other distributed systems technologies. Some of the application areas in which blockchain pilots are being carried out are: smart contracts, supply chain management, Know Your Customer (KYC), derivatives processing and provenance management. A couple of production deployments are also in place now. In this tutorial, I survey some of the ongoing projects with respect to their architectures in general and their approaches to some specific technical areas. Specifically, I focus on how the functionality of traditional and modern data stores are being utilized or not utilized in the different blockchain projects."

While microprocessor and memory chip manufacturers are the leading drivers of innovation, several other technology sectors benefit from the technologies that enable Moore's law scaling. Image sensor manufacturers, in particular, have realized many advancements from the selective use of advanced wafer fabrication and packaging developments. The motivations for the imaging industry to pursue advanced technology generation scaling are comparable to that of the broader semiconductor industry. In addition, image sensor companies seek a reduction of the camera module form factor, an increase in camera resolution, and an increase in pixel array performance. The pixel size of recent camera phone sensors has shrunk to 1.12 $\mu{\rm m}$. This is about half the pixel size of leading edge devices of six years prior, and yet mobile imaging sensors have dramatically increased in performance. Design innovation continues to have an increasing contribution to the performance of leading edge pixels; however, to date, it has been fabrication process development that has substantially enabled the continuous breakthroughs in digital imaging. Current image sensor fabrication process flows mark a significant departure from conventional CMOS logic processes. Beyond silicon foundry processes, digital imaging companies must also concern themselves with the optical systems, packaging solutions, and image processing chips required to integrate their silicon devices with the consumer electronics supply chain. Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of image sensor technologies as they come into production. Chipworks has obtained charge-coupled devices and CMOS image sensor chips from leading manufacturers and performed structural, compositional, and design analyses to benchmark the successful technologies employed by the market leaders. © 1988-2012 IEEE."

The added feature allows non-contact probing of die pads and provides a reliable alternative solution to mechanical probing for electrical wafer sort testing of Systems-on-Chip (SoC) and Systems-in-Package (SiPs) because of elimination of pad damage and reduction of the force required to create stable electrical contacts between probe needles and pads. The proposed receiver detects the displacement current flowing through the capacitive channel created between the connecting probe needle and top metal pad surface when a transition in the input digital stimulus signal occurs. The receiver is designed to work up to 100 Mbit/s data rate with a power of 340 μrm W in a 40 nm CMOS process. The circuit trade-offs between frequency, amplitude of the step input and distance are discussed. Experimental results show that for a 5 V input voltage amplitude, the receiver allows correct data transmission at a distance up to 5 μm, which increases to 10 μm if the top aluminum layer is divided in two, using a customized I/O pad design. The feasibility of this non-contact testing approach was verified through electrical tests on two IP blocks, an LFSR, and a PLL with a scan chain, using a standard prober and a cantilever probe card designed with 19 needles of different lengths to enable both physical contact connections for power supply and non-contact capacitive coupling data communication for signals."

By including Cyber-Physical-Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-47 Brettel et al."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of supply chain lead-time averages and variability on an organization's financial performance. Design/methodology/approach – The "" executive "" list for manufacturers, consisting of 1,264 individuals of the Institute of Supply Management provided the study's sampling frame, with surveys sent to 402 firms and responses obtained from 210 firms. The empirical model is tested using LISREL. Findings – The results show that as variance in supply chain lead-times increases, the financial performance of the organization decreases. Of equal significance, the results show that average supply chain lead-times have no direct impact on financial performance. The results also indicate that demand uncertainty associates with greater supply chain lead-time variance and that production technology routineness associates with lower supply chain lead-time variance. Product complexity and organizational size have no impact on supply chain lead-time variance or supply chain lead-time average. Research limitations/implications – The research is an initial effort to understand variance in supply chain systems. An ongoing challenge in this area is operationalization of measures and data collection techniques that go beyond a single firm and examine a network of organizations cooperating in a value-added supply chain. Practical implications – The results suggest that managing the variance in a supply chain system may be more important to an organization's financial performance than managing averages. Originality/value – This is particularly significant since organizations often act contrary to these findings, focusing scarce resources on reducing average lead-times rather than on reducing variability in supply chain lead-times."

The system is fully integrated in a standard 0.35-μm CMOS technology, including all auxiliary circuits. Two channels are available in order to process both atrial and ventricular signals. CMOS translinear circuits, with particular emphasis on log-domain techniques, have been exploited in order to contain current consumption and to allow correct operation with a reduced supply voltage, due to battery discharging. Indeed, the realized system can operate down to 1.8 V of supply voltage and dissipates at most 1.8 μA, granting at least 47 dB of dynamic range (DR) for the atrial chain, which is compatible with advanced digital sensing. Current consumption can be further reduced at the expense of DR if a simpler sensing like peak detection is adopted. All system performance have been verified by measurements results and are compatible with the requirements of cardiac pacemakers. This work, therefore, demonstrates how a proper design approach, exploiting low-power and low-voltage techniques, allows one to optimize performance for the cardiac pacemaker. © 2004 IEEE."

Despite ever-improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come from remote hacking to establish persistent covert access, supply chain operations that insert compromised hardware or software, malicious actions by trusted insiders, and mistakes by system users. [...]the cyber threat cannot be eliminated. Examples of cyber incidents with real world consequences include a cyber attack on a Ukrainian power network in 2015 that caused power outages for several hours and a ?ransomware? software designed to block a user's access to data, sometimes by encrypting it infection that forced a hospital in the United Kingdom in late 2016 to cancel scheduled medical procedures, divert trauma patients to other hospitals, and impact access to essential services such as blood transfusions. National and domestic security interests are an important component of global Internet policy, as is a robust and stable global digital economy and the free flow of information online.

The impact at Eastman Kodak Co has been profound affecting the whole service parts value chain. Kodak brainstormed over the challenge and realized that its service parts value chain could be reengineered with two types of engagements -- field engineer engagement and its service parts supply chain team engagement. The next phase of its analysis was to prepare a business case for its idea of centralizing expensive parts at strategic field locations and delivering them on demand to field engineers. Data validated that its pooled inventory concept called forward stock locations (FSL) did indeed present a robust business case. Based on the metrics Kodak has tracked, it believes that the FSLs have achieved many of its objectives. The biggest lesson from the FSL program is that nobody should ever assume that a business process cannot be improved significantly."

The interventions needed to mitigate the transmission and provide relief to those afflicted with Covid-19 range from vaccines and drugs to ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPEs). Developing multitudes of these interventions in a very short period requires a strategic, multi-disciplinary and agile approach. Organisations need a strong R&D base with robust capability and capacity in multiple disciplines to rise to this challenge. The article covers the contribution of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) towards the mitigation of Covid-19. These are broadly classified into five areas: (1) Digital and Molecular Surveillance; (2) Rapid and Economical Diagnostics; (3) New and Repurposed Drugs; (4) Hospital Assistive Devices and PPEs and (5) Supply Chain and Logistics. The varied contributions of CSIR would not have been possible without its strength in R&D across a broad spectrum of science and engineering and its dedicated scientific manpower and active partnership with industry.

The work began with collecting common system requirements from 10 sub-Saharan African countries; these requirements represented the countries' vision of an ideal system to track individual child vaccination schedules and elements of supply chain. Through iterative development processes in both Tanzania and Zambia, the common requirements were modified and adapted to better fit the country contexts and users' needs, as well as to be developed with the technology available at the time. This process happened across four different software platforms.

Ensemble discharges were obtained by digital treatment of the discharges in afferent fibers from all the spindles in peroneus tertius as recorded from the muscle nerve. Stimulation of each group prevented ensemble discharges from falling to very low levels during shortening phases. However, this effect was clearly larger when the group of fast-conducting axons was stimulated. In view of the known effects of the activation of bag2 and chain fibers (either separately or together) on single primary ending discharges during comparable sinusoidal stretches, this stronger effect supports the view that static γ axons with faster conduction velocities are more likely to supply more bag2 fibers than slower ones. Possibly the proportions of bag2 and chain fibers activated during motor activity are determined by a recruitment of static γ motoneurons related to their size."

We formalize and provide an illustrative example for a model that can facilitate the measurement of information flow latency within organizations and discuss the benefits associated with the model. The proposed latency measure is unique in that it facilitates the measurement of information flow and process latency. The measure is a very important in that it can assist management in improving the most critical business processes in their company. Moreover, an assurance service can be developed in order to increase the trust in the digitization level of business partners.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of the literature on Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR). The review emphasises the descriptors of CPFR implementation and models, as well as the impact of CPFR and other supply chain collaboration (SCC) initiatives on supply chain (SC) performance. Design/methodology/approach – The systematic review includes 50 full-text papers retrieved from four databases: Emerald, EBSCO, ScienceDirect and Wiley. Rigorous and verifiable keywords, review steps and selection criteria were applied to the database and inter-coders agreement was systematically checked. Findings – There is no consensus regarding the breadth and scope of CPFR configurations. CPFR is context-dependent and varies according to the configuration of the SC. Trust, information-communication technology and the quality of information sharing are main enablers and inhibitors of implementation. Practical implications – Practitioners will benefit from insights related to the choice of SCC configurations (e.g. number of partners, nature of products and spatial complexity), the importance of trust and empowerment for SCC and the need to outweigh carefully the costs and benefits of specific SCC before implementation. Originality/value – CPFR, which is considered by many to be the most advanced and the most comprehensive SCC process and has a direct impact upon SC performance. Nonetheless, efforts to synthesise the overall state of the art in CPFR have been rather limited to date. As an effort to fill this gap, this paper provides a better understanding of the role of CPFR as a determinant of SC performance. As an effort to contribute to complete the cycle of theory building based on the literature review, seven propositions for CPFR research are put forward."

Advancing the availability of data sharing contracts has led to novel internal and external operational efficiencies and to new types of strategic opportunities. Data sharing is nothing new. Approximately 49% of the companies already share data with other companies. How has data sharing emerged between companies? What types of benefits have companies reached by sharing data? Those are the two research questions we are answering in this study. Additionally, we map the trajectory of data sharing technologies and their benefits for companies. External strategic opportunities cannot be reached unless the product, service and software architectures are modular; in addition, the boundary resources are not being considered by the companies. Finally, the tools for evaluating the value capture of indirect network effects is missing from widely accepted business case valuation methods. The question remains - what type of data resources can companies treat as proprietary or as shared?"

It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the grid.

In fashion studies and in the sociology of the fashion a body of work is currently developing around the concept of digital fashion. Fashion scholars argue that a new trend is emerging -open, democratic, shared and hyper-technological -able to transform the canons of taste, costume and design. The vast majority of the literature on digitization has focused on the fact the fashion companies suffer, and partly incorporate, the seduction typical of digital aesthetics. Social networks and blogs have enhanced the way through which fashion brands communicate their imaginary: from their website to online streaming fashion show, from apps to online showroom. In this paper we show the relevance of theories of digitization to an understanding of the contemporary field of fashion design. Digital has in fact also entered the world of production overturning the rules and conventions of one of the sacred places of creation, the atelier. Digital fabrication, based on open design, 3D prints, digital laser cutting and engraving, has transformed creative and productive phases, developing a concept of popular crafts, re-contextualized and enhanced. 1 The research presented in this book/article was produced with funds from MIUR PRIN 2010-2011. The survey "" Sustainable practices of everyday life in the context of the crisis: toward the integration of work, consumption and participation "" was coordinated by Laura Bovone (Catholic University of Milan) and envisaged the participation of the following public university: Milan (coord. Luisa Leonini), Bologna (coord. Roberta Patrinieri), Trieste (coord. Giorgio Osti), Molise (coord. Guido Gili), Rome ""La Sapienza"" (coord. Antimo Farro), Naples Federico II (coord. Antonella Spanò). In particular, and through a discussion of cases of collaborative fashion production, we focus on the idea of digitization as articulated through collaboration. Designers, stylists, tailors, costume designers meet online to share their creativity and their knowledge and thereby contribute both to the creation of a shared collection and to the public dissemination of sketches and patterns. The future of fashion is, therefore, a digital present that is transforming the Web from a simple communication tool to democratic sharing platform. The concept of collaborative production, we argue, allows us to capture the deeply intertwined nature of fashion and digital media and moreover allows design system to foster a more ethical and sustainable fashion because they shorten the supply chain, encourage direct knowledge of the protagonists and facilitate the use of local resources."

Data consumers have signed up from 94 countries, with around half of active users from outside the UK. In April, users downloaded some 97,540 well data files, 1,913 2D seismic files, and 559 3D seismic files.In the right hands, the dataset is intended to provide insight into the evolution and future potential of exploration and production (E&P) on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) through interpretation of public well, geophysical, field, and infrastructure data—spanning from the birth of the North Sea as a petroleum province to the present.At least one operator is already taking the opportunity to use the database to search for prospective acreage. The NDR “adds momentum to Talon Petroleum’s push into the North Sea,” said Matthew Worner, director at West Perth, Australia-based Talon, as he took to Twitter following the repository’s unveiling. The company’s purchase this year of “specialist UK explorer” EnCounter Oil has it “well positioned to use the data from this release to identify exploration targets in future licensing rounds,” he said.Worner’s comments are an encouraging sign for the OGA, whose purpose for the release is to help renew interest in exploration and development and stimulate innovation on the UKCS, said Nic Granger, director of corporate at the OGA. “In terms of who we’re targeting, we’re looking to encourage inward investment into the UKCS,” she told JPT.Important, Granger noted, is that the data are “being opened up for the first time to organizations that aren’t operators,” namely those involved in the supply chain and technology innovators experimenting with machine learning and artificial intelligence.The OGA is further promoting collaboration on technology development with the May launch of its UKCS technology portal. It allows operators to share lessons learned on technology deployment and facilitates engagement with the supply chain and tech firms to address development opportunities.Data-Sharing EmphasisInformation sharing—namely data sharing—is one of the OGA’s top priorities. Since it was established in 2015, the OGA has made available seismic data, digital well logs, geological mapping, and various kinds of reports from the field.The regulator has a portfolio of prospects that goes back decades thanks to early data-collection efforts by the British Geological Survey, said Nick Richardson, head of exploration and new ventures at the OGA, during a recent exploration-focused OGA podcast. “We’re going to try and make as much of that information as openly accessible as possible so that companies can look at it and derive new insights,” he said."

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims to assess the current practice in research on supply chain management applying a case study method. Two particular research fields, namely sustainable supply chain management (SustSCM) and performance supply chain management (PerformSCM), are used as examples. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on a content analysis, where quality criteria for documenting case study research are analyzed. A total of 68 papers from the two research fields (51 SustSCM and 17 PerformSCM) forms the sample. The criteria of analysis chosen are taken from the case study research process. Findings – There are two major findings: first, supply chain researchers have to make a greater effort to collect data from supply chains (i.e. at least two, or better, three or more stages of the supply chains). Second, the research process needs to be more comprehensively documented in related peer-reviewed journal publications. This way, the value of case study based research might be appreciated more, as well enabling stronger conclusions to be drawn on the individual piece of research. Research limitations/implications – The research presented focuses on two particular fields inside SCM. However, the observations made that methodological rigor is often lacking in the papers holds for both fields. Originality/value – The paper contributes to the further development of appropriate empirical research strategies for supply chain management."

From 2015, UNFPA and USAID collaborated to pilot test how tracking and tracing of bar coded health products could be operational-ized in the public health supply chains of Ethiopia and Pakistan and inform the ecosystem needed to begin full implementation. Pakistan had been using proprietary bar codes for inventory management of contraceptive supplies but transitioned to global standards-based bar codes during the pilot. The transition allowed Pakistan to leverage the original bar codes that were preprinted by global manufacturers as opposed to printing new bar codes at the central warehouse. However, barriers at lower service delivery levels prevented full realization of end-to-end data visibility. Key barriers at the district level were the lack of a digital inventory management system and absence of bar codes at the primary-level packaging level, such as single blister packs. The team in Ethiopia developed an open-sourced smartphone application that allowed the team to scan bar codes using the mobile phone's camera and to push the captured data to the country's data mart. Real-time tracking and tracing occurred from the central warehouse to the Addis Ababa distribution hub and to 2 health centers. These pilots demonstrated that standardized product identification and bar codes can significantly improve accuracy over manual stock counts while significantly streamlining the stock-taking process, resulting in efficiencies. The pilots also showed that bar coding technology by itself is not sufficient to ensure data visibility. Rather, by using global standards for identification and data capture of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and integrating the data captured into national and global tracking systems, countries are able to lay the foundation for interoperability and ensure a harmonized language between global health stakeholders."

The model includes a general network structure considering both forward and reverse processes that can be used in various industries, such as electronics, digital equipment, and vehicles. Because logistic network design is a time consuming and costly project as well as a strategic and sensitive decision (i.e. the change of such decision is difficult in the future), a robust optimisation approach is adopted to cope with the uncertainty of demand and the return rate described by a finite set of possible scenarios. Hence, to obtain robust solutions with better time, the scenario relaxation algorithm is employed for the proposed model. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are presented to demonstrate the significance and applicability of the presented model. It is shown that solutions resulted from the suggested approach insure more situations, especially in worst case ones. The results show that although the profit values of the robust configuration are less than the deterministic configuration, the robust configuration is more reliable than the deterministic one because the deterministic configuration is infeasible under some demand and return rates (i.e. in the worst cases). Moreover, the results show the computing time superiority of the algorithm compared to the extensive form model as well as optimality of the resulted solutions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited."

The interlobate esker complex hosting the managed aquifer recharge (MAR) plant is the source of the entire water supply for the city of Turku and its surrounding municipalities. An accurate delineation of the aquifer is therefore critical for long-term MAR planning and sustainable use of the esker resources. Moreover, an additional target was to resolve the poorly known stratigraphy of the 70–100-m-thick glacial deposits overlying a zone of fractured bedrock. Bedrock surface as well as fracture zones were confirmed through combined reflection seismic and refraction tomography results and further validated against existing borehole information. The high-resolution seismic data proved successful in accurately delineating the esker cores and revealing complex stratigraphy from fan lobes to kettle holes, providing valuable information for potential new pumping wells.

Accomplishing these necessities requires a complete signal communications chain of high-performance components and effective signal processing communication techniques to provide system reliability. Nevertheless, noise interference, cable attenuation and thermal drift of the front-end passive electronic elements can lead to poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and possibly loss of the communication link. This paper describes a signal processing algorithm implemented in a bidirectional communication system that exchanges data from a down-hole high pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) measurement tool to the surface installation. The communication channel is a multi-conductor coaxial logging cable also used as a power supply transmission line. The instrumentation system consists of a proprietary down-hole measurement tool, composed of an HPHT sensor and a high-temperature digital signal processor (DSP)-based electronic device; located in the surface installation is a data-acquisition equipment. The system employs a signal processing algorithm, based on the frequency domain SNR characterization of the whole communication chain, which determines in real time the optimal carrier frequency that is automatically implemented in the selected modulation/demodulation technique. The obtained laboratory test results of the down-hole tool, using changes in temperature from 25° to 185°C, provide a firm basis for testing and evaluating the system in the field."

Organic agriculture can be an alternative solution because it has a right balance in terms of the environment, health and benefits for local farmers. However, high prices for organic products and low production scale limit the growth of the domestic organic food market. This research aims to analyze organic food’s consumer behavior, analyze the existing marketing channels and formulate alternative marketing channels for the domestic organic food supply chain. Sampling was carried out by purposive sampling method in which the criteria for respondents were those who know about organic food and live in five big cities in Java and Bali. The marketing channel survey was conducted in Jakarta and West Java by interviewing each actor in the value chain. The results showed that organic food’s market opportunity was quite large, because the respondents were generally aware that organic food was good for health. Organic food consumers are currently included in the middle-class segment, aged 20-50 years, office workers, and income more than IDR 9 million a month. For consumers, certification labels are more important than brands in organic food. On the one hand, organic marketing channels still vary widely. In the B2C market, the use of digital marketing can minimize the financial risks of organic farmers. On the other hand, the B2B market can be optimized through cooperation in hotels, restaurants, cafes, hospitals, and the healthy food processing industry, supported by government policies.

Bitcoin is an example which bypasses the need for a bank to achieve transparent transactions. Industrial applications are asset tracking, authentication, and the Internet of Things (IOT). Design: We reviewed commercially available Blockchain systems (IBM, Microsoft), emerging platforms (GemOS), and published literature on Blockchain within healthcare. Taking into account the limits and power of Blockchain, we proposed innovative pathology applications through the following use cases. Results: Surgical specimen tracking: Pathology departments alongside IT could utilize libraries in the emerging Blockchain marketplace based on the Ethereum platform such as Microsoft Azure for implementing affordable, home grown asset tracking solutions (Fig 1). “Public” pathology record system: A pathology “on chain” record can be accessed (securely and cryptically via permissioned keys) for a given patient nationwide, in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-agnostic manner. The “on chain” components for a biopsy could be: Diagnosis, grade, immunophenotype, and molecular features. This no-frills data formatting will aid Health Information Exchange (HIE), especially in making rapid decisions on a new patient or in a frozen section scenario. The metadata benefits for such a national record are limitless (Fig 2). Accessing Anatomical Pathology Lab Information Systems (LIS) nationwide: “Off chain” records residing in EHR data lakes, such as the full pathology report, pictures, and Whole Slide Images can be accessed via Blockchain identity authentication tools integrated into surgical pathology LIS. This can facilitate second opinions and extra-institutional consultations through secure interoperability. The “Pathology” IOT: Smart contracts have many applications for the pathology lab. Smart cassettes, for example, could alert the lab technician when CAP recommendations for formalin fixation times are not met. Similarly, a set of smart tubes can alert the phlebotomist of a wrong filling order. Also, “digital wallets” can be created to track supply stocks and automatically reorder needed materials. Conclusions: We are at the forefront of Blockchain's use in healthcare. The field of pathology could benefit via applications in specimen tracking, public record for specimens, authentication of surgical pathology LIS access, and the “Internet of (Pathology) things.” (Figure Presented)."

The networks gives the opportunity to learn more about the details of the visits of each customers (e.g., the numbers of views per object, witch objects are in observation list, from witch site the customer comes, how much time did you take to evaluate the purchase, how much is the average of orders for each customer, which are the best-selling combinations, etc). The traditional retail still has the lion's share of the market, due to the possibility to see and choose products in a real environment, and to the possibility to be able to talk with real people in case of problems. However, on the information side, the gap between real and digital retail is still far from being bridged. This article will present the emerging technologies for customer behavior analysis in traditional retail, which will allow in the coming years to reach the same wealth of information that now is available only in the digital world."

It involves online transactions, supply chain management, e-marketing, electronic data interchange, automated inventory management systems and automated data collection systems. Companies all over the world are finding e-commerce as the new platform for the business in the years to come.India has the fourth largest Internet users in the world so it is expected to come among the top 10 e-commerce hub by 2015. The Indian e-commerce market has recorded an impressive growth rate of 47% to over Rs.46,000 crore in the 2011 as compared to Rs.31,598 crore in 2010. This change is recorded mainly due to sustained growth of online travel industry.For the faster growth and smooth running of e-commerce it has become very important to have effective laws to cater the need of the time. There have always been threats in the processing of personal information due to phishing, spoofing, identity theft, fraudulent emails and viruses & malware attack. Other prominent issue is related to taxation on e -commerce transactions. E-commerce transaction raises several taxation issues, because it is completed in cyber space and there is an absence of national boundaries, and in some cases non-requirement of physical presence of goods & physical delivery. This makes traditional rules of taxation difficult to apply due to the level of disintermediation and untraceability of the path of transactions, The theme of the paper is the threats & challenges of e- commerce. Motive of this paper is to analyse the effectiveness of law in the present scenario of increasing cyber crime, identifying the shortcomings and find out the corrective means.

Building Information Modelling (BIM) based technologies have emerged for communication, data exchange and sharing between project delivery actors within a virtual 3D environment, where analysis and management of sustainability indicators is aided by information driven software and systems. Significant challenges, however, exist in relation to characteristics and current capability of technologies to deliver effective exchange. The challenges broadly relate to lack of interoperability, security and lack of adaptable standards, which is exacerbated by increasing intensity, size and complexity of data requirements to meet evolving knowledge base for sustainability management through communication and information modelling. In addition to dire effects on efficiency, effectiveness and cost of mitigation, it is argued that a key consequence of these challenges is an increasing perception of risk in relation to implementation challenges, information security and data integrity, which is causing reluctance to use BIM for information exchange.

Abstract Purpose – The concept of the customer order decoupling point (CODP) has been used in many different contexts as an important structural concept for the traditional forward supply chain. The CODP is rarely explicitly applied in reverse supply chain management and the purpose of this paper is to show that the CODP can be an important corner stone of a framework for analysis of the closed-loop supply chain containing both forward and reverse material flows. Design/methodology/approach – Conceptual similarities are identified using analogies between forward and reverse supply chains. First, the concepts are discussed in their original context of forward flows and thereafter the concepts are applied on reverse flows. Finally, a holistic closed-loop model is established. Findings – The conventional CODP framework for forward flow supply chains can be extended to cover also reverse material flows and therefore providing a foundation for a more comprehensive discussion of closed-loop supply chains useful in both education, research, and industrial applications. Using the suggested extended framework it is possible to identify nine fundamental supply chain configurations. Practical implications – Differentiating between demand driven and forecast driven activities plays a critical role in practical supply chain management and this paper highlights that this approach also can be applied to closed-loop supply chains and therefore extending the reach of the toolbox previously developed for the forward supply chain. Originality/value – The concept CODP has not previously been comprehensively treated for the closed-loop supply chain and this paper provides a foundation for establishing a strategic structural framework for discussing issues such as lean vs agile and balancing efficiency and responsiveness in a more comprehensive context involving also reverse material flows."

Enterprises joining these networks face difficulties when they have to manage and orchestrate information within the network, namely due to the lack of interoperability between the systems and software applications operating between them. The furniture industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the world, involving mostly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The development of collaborative networked environments in this industrial sector has been identified of major importance, looking forward to enabling enterprises to extend the potential of their own business capabilities. Indeed, to keep its competitiveness, industry needs to accomplish rapidly the requirements in the digital global marketplace, and push promptly SME-based enterprises to adopt seamless electronic business services in networked environments, using modern ICT and standards among all agents involved in the furniture product life cycle. The funStep case study presented in this article developed a framework to accelerate the integration of enterprises in collaborative working environments, solving information interoperability problems in the furniture supply chain. The funStep framework enables gradual and sustained system interoperability, allowing incremental implementations using conformance options and classes. The funStep created an ISO standard which defines a formal structure for catalogue and product data under industrial domains of the furniture sector. Then, the ICT combined with the use of open-standards, and enriched by semantics representation, resulted in a suitable tool to improve enterprise competitiveness via a wider adoption of STEP Application Protocols in collaborative environments. Model Driven Architecture technology is used to enable automation of Model Morphisms, and therefore, translation at the information model and data levels. A reference ontology integrated in the standard product data model, permits an intelligent management at semantic level, providing enhanced capabilities for interoperability. The results of the case study presented stimulate enterprises on the adoption of technologies and practices to reach the future vision of furniture manufacturing business based on collaborative networked environments. It prepares industry and researchers to advance on the state of the art, and to establish solid proposals for the industry in general.

The design is based on a RF (Radio Frequency) and linear IF (Intermediate Frequency) chain where the signal amplification is done in the RF front-end blocks and analog VGAs (variable gain amplifiers). The gains of the RF block and VGA are digitally controlled by the DAGC (Digital AGC) block to ensure that the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) operates inside its dynamic range. Feedback loop architecture is employed for the advantage of high linearity due to its inherent characteristic. The whole AGC loop has been integrated in the ZigBee transceiver which was fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS technology. The AGC loop achieves a dynamic range of about 95 dB with the gain error of less than ±0.5 dB. The two-channel VGAs and peak detectors occupy an area of 1.5 mm×0.4 mm and dissipate 1.71 mW from a single 1.8 V power supply. The DAGC has been integrated in the digital baseband processor and occupies an area of about 0.4 mm×0.4 mm. The max gain lock time of the AGC loop is about 1.25 μs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Various techniques have proposed circuit configurations which do not allow the untrusted fab to decipher the true functionality and/or produce usable versions of the chip without having access to the locking key. These techniques rely on using additional locking circuitry which injects incorrect behavior into the digital functionality when the key is incorrect. However, much of this conventional research focuses on locking individual modules (such as adders, ALUs etc.). While locking these modules is useful, the true test for any locking scheme should consider their impact on the application running on a processor with such modules. A locked module within a processor may or may not have a substantial impact at the application level thereby allowing the attacker (untrusted foundry or unauthorized user) to still get useful work out of the system despite not having access to the key details. In this work, we show that even when state of the art locking schemes are used to lock the modules within a processor, a large class of workloads derived from machine learning (ML) applications (which are increasingly becoming the most relevant ones) continue to function correctly. This has huge implications to the effectiveness of the current locking techniques. The main reason for this behavior is the inherent error resiliency of such applications. To counter this threat, we propose a novel secure and effective logic locking scheme, called Strong Anti-SAT (SAS), to lock the entire processor and make sure that the ML applications undergo significant accuracy loss when any wrong key is applied. We provide two types of SAS, namely SAS-A and SAS-B. Experiments show that, for both types of SAS, 1) the application-level accuracy loss is significant (for ML applications) given any wrong key, 2) the attacker needs extremely long time to find a correct key, and 3) the hardware overhead is very small. Lastly, even though our techniques target machine learning type application workloads, the impact on conventional workloads will also be similar. Due to the inherent error resilience of ML, locking ML workloads is a harder problem to tackle."

Abstract Purpose – The objective of this paper is to present different perspectives on building "" trust "" among supply chain participants working on construction projects. Design/methodology/approach – A case study methodology was adopted; with five construction projects selected as five case studies for the trust in construction project on the basis a selection criteria devised for the research project. Over 40 interviews were conducted with participants operating at different levels in their respective organisations and at different point in the supply chain. Findings – The information provided by the multiple informants was, to a large extent, consistent with much of the academic literature relating to the importance of and barriers to trust. Specifically, the case studies highlighted: what people within the construction industry understand by trust, reliance, and honest professional relationship; the key factors that contribute towards building trust and factors that result into breakdown of trust; and organisational and project related factors that influence trust and relationships among people within the industry. Research limitations/implications – The findings from this study are limited due to: a small number of case studies undertaken, focused within the North West Region of England, and limited time and resources available. However, the ideas proposed for ways to develop trust in construction projects as seen from project findings have important implications for not only the clients but also for the main contractors and sub-contractors who need to pay greater attention to build trusting and long-term relationship as part of an integrated supply chain in order to deliver the continuous demand for services especially from public sector clients. Practical implications – If more businesses operating in the construction sector gave more thought to the importance of trust in construction projects then this could have a significant impact on contract design and over all procurement strategy. Specifically the repetitive work carried out by the local authorities in the UK, such as school building and maintenance, social housing stock improvement, etc., can be subcontracted to the contractors on a longer term basis resulting into long term supply chain relationship among organisations and cost savings. Originality/value – The research is among the first attempts in response to Latham report published in 1994, in order to explore the role of trust in construction projects, from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. The paper provides insights into the practical issues that prevent the widespread development of trust within the construction industry, which is a challenge that clearly warrants further attention from academics and practitioners."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review extant literature and present a proposed research agenda to examine whether environmental, i.e. green performance measures, can be integrated within an existing supply chain performance framework, explore what a meaningful industry-recognised environmental measure should look like, and understand the direct benefits of incorporating environmental measures within a supply chain performance framework. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an extensive literature review in four key areas: performance management, supply chain performance management, environmental management and benchmarking. Findings – The literature suggests there is an opportunity to explore the relationship between the environment and logistics and that environmental supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) should enable organisations to more effectively benchmark their supply chain environmental performance. A framework incorporating these notions and a research agenda for empirical study are also presented. Practical implications – The paper provides direction for practitioners on measuring the environmental impact of their supply chains in the context of their overall business performance. The proposed research agenda integrates an environmental measure into an extant supply chain performance framework to provide practitioners with a more holistic view of their supply chain performance in relation to competitors. Originality/value – There has been limited research conducted in this area. This paper provides insights into developing a green SCPM framework. 1. Introduction Performance measurement systems are important in supply chain management (SCM). Over the last few decades there has been a transition from traditional, stand-alone performance measures to more sophisticated and balanced ways of measuring supply chain performance. This transition has been driven by increased complexity and supply chain globalisation and an attempt by supply chain managers and others to increase visibility over areas that are not directly within their control. Supply chain performance measures have conventionally been orientated around cost, time and accuracy. However, organisations are now coming under increased scrutiny from customers and governments regarding their compliance with environmental and social responsibility. Notwithstanding these pressures there has only been limited research into incorporating an environmental measure or metric into the existing bank of supply chain performance measures. Thus, there is a danger that environmental and traditional supply chain measures will disappear along divergent paths."

Abstract Purpose – The paper aims to present a conceptual framework for analysing CSR practices in global supply chains. It also seeks to demonstrate how a pioneering Swedish company, IKEA, implements and manages CSR practices at its suppliers. Design/methodology/approach – A case analysis of IKEA illustrates the implementation and management of CSR practices in supply chains. The focus is on internal and external integration of CSR practices in the supply chain. IKEA holds a leading position in its supply chain and is a global brand-owner. Personal interviews are performed with employees from one of the company's trading areas. Findings – Practising CSR in supply chains requires that CSR is embedded within the entire organisation, including subsidiaries abroad and offshore suppliers. It includes employee training and sharing of experience, training of key personnel at the supplier level, positive incentives for suppliers in the form of long-term contracts and enlarged purchasing orders, and regular auditing of suppliers' performance. Research limitations/implications – The paper focuses on CSR practices in a specific company's supply chain. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalised to other companies. Also, the practices have been studied from the perspective of the focal company. Practical implications – The CSR practices of IKEA can serve as inspiration for other companies that are considering adopting corporate codes of conduct. Originality/value – The paper presents a company that has a long tradition for working with environmental and social issues. The paper demonstrates how the actual management of CSR practices is determined by context-dependent factors."

Die Kreativität, mit der nun über die weitere Professionalisierung der Logistik in Industrie- und Handelsunternehmen, sowie auch bei den Logistik dienstleistern an neuen Prozessen und Anwendungen gearbeitet wird, ist entfesselt worden. Nun hat jedoch die Logistik zum einen eine Logik, die sowohl aus Transaktionen besteht, die digital erweitert und effizienter gestaltet werden können. Zum anderen ist Logistik jedoch auch physische Warenbewegung. Daher ist die Logistik im Sinne der Digitalisierung immer ein hybrides Geschäft, wenn man alle Komponenten einer integrierten Logistik in die Betrachtung einbezieht. Sie ist sozusagen ein cyberphysisch-soziales System. Eine sehr große Aufmerksamkeit haben derzeit die vielen neuen Startups in der Branche, die sich mit Ineffizienzen und deren Lösungen beschäftigen oder einfach nur bestimmte Funktionen, welche rein digital realisiert werden können, anbieten. Die vorliegende Arbeit bietet hierzu einen hervorragenden Überblick, der wohl so bisher nicht möglich war, da die Unternehmensformen und deren Funktionen in einer Gesamtbetrachtung zuvor nicht so sorgfältig recherchiert wurden. Es wird sich dann jedoch zeigen, welche Ideen der Startups es schaffen werden, tatsächliche Relevanz in großen integrierten Logistiklösungen zu erzeugen. Denn es ist ein Unterschied, eine einfache Commodity-Transaktion ins Internet zu verlagern oder eine weltweit integrierte Logistik für eine intermodale Supply-Chain für permanente Warenbewegungen zu planen und täglich zu betreiben. Ich wünsche den Lesern viele gute Erkenntnisse und den Startups ein gutes Gelingen in ihrer Anschlussfähigkeit für zukunftsfähige Lösungen"

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present the relationship between supply chain linkages and supply chain performance (cost-containment and reliability of supply chain partners). Design/methodology/approach – Multivariate regression models are developed in order to identify the characteristics of determinants of linkages in the supply chain stakeholders (suppliers, internal stakeholders and customers). The survey was administered to individuals identified from a list of US executive officers, directors, presidents, or vice presidents. Among four hundred respondents, 122 were considered as valid from those who practice supply chain management for their business operations. Findings – Internal integration is the most important contributor to cost-containment while integration with the supplier is the best strategy to achieve supply chain reliable performance. Availability of electronic ordering systems for customers is an important strategy in cost-containment. Fast and easy ordering is the best strategy for customer in performance reliability. Reliable delivery with supplier collaboration in managing a broad supply chain operation is the best way to link with suppliers. Access to the inventory information creates the most favorable environment in internal integration. Research limtations/implications – A vigorous multivariate statistical modeling process was employed to seek a possible linkage between the level of integration and the supply chain performances at a different linkage stage. This study would open an avenue for further investigation using micro data such as financial performances, and other key supply chain indicators to operationalize some of the findings that this study presented. Practical implications – This paper explored the relationship between supply chain linkages and supply chain performance so that management will be able to pursue better supply chain strategies applicable directly to their business environment. Study results provide management with innovative insights for planning and executing applicable supply chain strategies. Originality/value – This study presented overall and individual determinants of each linkage affecting supply chain performance. In addition, this study presented a valid and reliable measurement instruments that academicians as well as practitioners can use in measuring the supply chain performance."

Improving health care efficiency with social, mobile, analytics, and cloud technologies",Deloitte Center for Health Solutions (2016),false,"[""Greenspun H"",""Balan-Cohen A"",""Chang C"",""et al.See more""]",[],"Executive summary Social, mobile, analytics, and cloud (SMAC) technologies hold great potential to help health care organizations reduce costs, streamline inefficiencies, improve quality, and demonstrate value. Experience with SMAC in industries such as entertainment, consumer goods, and banking shows that while each of these technologies can generate benefits independently, they are even better together — joint application can improve business processes dramatically. In health care, this may translate to increased efficiency and lower costs. A 2014 survey of health information technology (IT) leaders found that the US health systems could in aggregate save a total of $23.4 billion in 2016 by implementing SMAC (11 percent of the savings from social media, 16 percent from mobile, 21 percent from analytics, and 20 percent from cloud). 1 To better understand the opportunities and challenges of using SMAC in health care, Deloitte spoke to industry experts and conducted secondary research. We identified four operational areas where SMAC technologies, singly or collectively, could be impactful. • Next-generation supply chain: After deploying radio frequency identification (RFID) tags to track medical and surgical supplies, 240-bed Concord Hospital in New Hampshire was able to reduce its inventory by 13 percent, with the largest decreases occurring in some of its most expensive departments: surgery, intensive care unit (ICU), and emergency. • Research and development (R&D): Pfizer leverages analytics to tailor treatments for specific patient populations. The company developed and launched the lung cancer drug Xalkori for a five-to-seven percent patient subset which has the ALK gene mutation and received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval based on clinical trials on only 255 patients. The total time from discovery to approval took three years, less than half the typical timeframe. • Care coordination: Washington State Medicaid enrolled its beneficiaries in a program that used a predictive modeling algorithm to determine who would benefit from a chronic care management program; this saved over $300 per member per month. • Digital health care payments: Annual savings from SMAC-based digital health care payments solutions could be as high as $8 billion for the overall health care industry. As examples, one health system saved 25 percent in administrative costs by investing in digital health care payments, and a physician office reduced its time spent on claims submission and patient payment processing by 88 percent, from several hours per day to mere minutes."

Successful electronic commerce activities depend on the partners involved in the product or service being delivered. Firms able to communicate with their partners electronically for procurement, sales, or supply chain management have become what many call clicks-and-mortar companies. An empirically based technological model that helps organizations understand the requirements of moving towards the seamless integration of intra- and inter-organizational processes is proposed. This five-wave transitional model accompanies key decision-makers through progressive steps that correspond to different business-to-business e-commerce needs and specifications. As organizations move along these technological waves, we can witness the gradual opening-up of new opportunities for carrying out business. This paper presents the model, its requirements and its technological and organizational underpinnings. The model is illustrated with examples from organizations in a major industrial sector."

This is currently ascribed to a malcrimped stapes prosthesis or to a compromised blood supply of the incus. The two-point fixation can cause a mucosal injury with a resulting toxic reaction, and also osteoclastic activity. An important aspect in the engineering of ideal stapes prostheses is that they should be fixed circularly to the long process of the incus with appropriate strength. The objective of this study was to compare current knowledge relating to the blood supply of the ossicular chain with the present authors' observations on cadaver incudes. Most of the papers dealing with this issue appeared in the mid-20th century. Methods: The published data were compared with the authors' findings gained from photodocumentation on 100 cadaver incudes. The photos were taken with a Canon EOS 20 digital camera (Canon, Inc., Lake Success, NY) with a 5:1 macro-objective. The long processes of the incudes were examined from four directions under a Leica surface-analyzing microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Results: Analysis of the positions of the entrances of the feeding arteries (nutritive foramina) on the incudes revealed 1-4 nutritive foramina on the long processes of 48% (24) of the left-sided incudes and 56% (28) of the right-sided incudes. The positions of these foramina differed, however, from those previously described in the literature. They were mostly located not on the medial side of the incus body or on the short process or on the cranial third of the long processes, but antero-medially, mostly on the middle or cranial third. In 48% of all the incudes examined, an obvious foramen was not observed either in the body or in the long process of the incus. No relationship was discerned between the chronological age of the incus specimens and the numbers and/or locations of the nutritive foramina. In each case, the opening of the foramen was the beginning of a tunnel running obliquely and medially upward through the corticalis of the long process of the incus. The foramina are thought to be capable of ensuring a richer blood supply between the surface and the inside of the long process, allowing the arteries to run in and out. Conclusions: These observations indicate that conclusions drawn from classical anatomical works appear to need reconsideration. The present authors consider that the reason for the necrosis of the long process of the incus is not a compromised blood supply, except in some exceptional anatomical situations. They discuss the possible reasons why malcrimping may lead to necrosis of the long process of the incus. To prevent such malcrimping, attention is paid to the new generation of prostheses. © 2009 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc."

After a number of years and in spite of an explosion of digital communications, the consumption of paper has only increased. At the same time, despite Toyota's success and improved production and communication technologies, total inventories have not decreased. The question is: What is behind the enlarged inventories? The answer is that inventories will stay with us for much longer and that they are directly linked to demand uncertainty. The bad news is that, despite scientific and technological progress, demand uncertainty tends to increase rather than to decrease. Add to that basic trends like increased variety, supply times, and shorter product life cycles. So, if inventories will not disappear, what is their ideal level? The answer points to the design of successful supply chains taking into account physical, financial, and information flows and stocks.

The following two questions serve as the motivation for the study: Do customer expectations of order fulfillment processes vary across product types? Should the product type matter in configuring order fulfillment processes? From the studies in the marketing literature, we infer that customer satisfaction assessments are based on customer expectations of order fulfillment processes, and that these expectations systematically vary across the three product types: convenience goods (e.g., groceries, home and office supplies), shopping goods (e.g., ready-to-wear men, women, and kids' apparel), and specialty goods (e.g., desktop and notebook computers, and wedding dresses). In particular, we posit that ceteris paribus, customer satisfaction with order fulfillment will decrease moving along a continuum of product types, from convenience goods to specialty goods. The empirical analysis for this study is based on data collected on dimensions of customer satisfaction with order fulfillment from a sample of 256 firms engaged in electronic B2C transactions. Firms included in our study sample are such that their products can be classified into only one of three product types: convenience, shopping, or specialty goods. In essence, each firm in the study sample is a proxy for one of three product types. The results of the empirical analysis indicate that, on average, customers tend to have higher satisfaction levels with the order fulfillment process of convenience and shopping goods than with the order fulfillment process of specialty goods. We discuss the managerial implications of our results, contributions of the paper to the literature, limitations, and directions for future research. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. all rights reserved."

In March 2010 Keyes was meeting with Hollywood studios in an effort to negotiate better terms for the $1 billion worth of merchandise Blockbuster had purchased the year before. In recent years, Blockbuster's share of the video rental market had been sharply decreasing in the face of competitors such as the low-cost, convenient Redbox vending machines and mail-order and video-on-demand service Netflix. While Blockbuster's market capitalization had dropped 47 percent to $62 million in 2009, Netflix's had shot up 55 percent to $3.9 billion that year. The only hope for Blockbuster, as Keyes saw it, was to shift its business model from primarily brick-and-mortar physical DVD rentals to increased digital and mail-order video delivery. In Keyes's favor, the studios were more than willing to provide him with that help. Hollywood wanted to see Blockbuster win the video-rental wars. Consumers still made frequent purchases of DVDs at its store—purchases which were much more profitable for studios than the rentals that remained Blockbuster's primary business. Blockbuster had made efforts at making its business model more nimble, but the results had been disappointing, and its debt continued to skyrocket. By the end of 2009, the company's debt had climbed to $856 million, its share of the $6.5 billion video rental business had fallen to 27 percent, and its revenues had tumbled 23 percent to $4.1 billion.The objective of this case is to discuss how different business models and supply chain structures impact the financials of the firms in the DVD rental business. In particular, the goal is to convey that the characteristics of the movie (recent/big hit or old/eclectic) affect whether it is best rented from a centralized or decentralized model. In addition, as streaming gains market share, the impact will be different for movie types and business models."

Information and communications technologies (ICT), especially mobile technologies (mHealth), have great promise in such settings, where they simultaneously present the highest potential in terms of enabling technology and have the highest pertinence for improving weak healthcare systems.mHealth has been used for large-scale disease surveillance, remote advice for practitioners, treatment compliance, and supply chain management in infectious disease programmes, but has found very limited adoption for diagnostics. Methods & Materials: We studied the landscapes of mHealth in the diagnostics of three major infectious diseases: HIV, TB and malaria. From January to July 2013, we analysed reports by global healthcare actors such as the WHO, WB and Stop TB Partnership, peer-reviewed publications related to ICT and healthcare, and other references sourced from these publications. The search was for English language publications only, leading to potential reporting bias. Taking a new technology-centred approach, we conceptualise mHealth architectures as three constituent elements: front-end (user device), back-end (IT infrastructure) and controller which links the two. Results: mHealth initiatives have targeted several components of the diagnostics pathway: Early case-detection, diagnosis and referral; Adherence to diagnostics protocols during consultations; Physical and digital transport of samples to diagnostics centres; Protocol adherence at the diagnostics hubs; Integration of results upstream into patient records and disease surveillance systems; Rapid communication of results downstream to the health facilities and patients. Recent efforts take a more holistic approach including efforts at automatic reporting of results from diagnostics centres to points of care, and integration of results into patient records. Some efforts seek to integrate ICT right into the diagnostics machines or rapid diagnostics tests. Conclusion: ICT has significant potential to become a major tool in improving the diagnostics processes of infectious diseases, though real-world implementations are severely lacking as of now. Our technology-oriented approach allows us to understand underlying features of 'successful' mHealth endeavours and delineate a panel to choose from for future implementations. This panel will further evolve as broadband networks spread, mobile devices have reduced cost-per-feature, and applications leverage increasedcomputational capacities of devices for in situ processing."

As newer products, replete with latest technologies, become available, the demand for older products erodes. To renew the competitiveness of a product, the manufacturer may upgrade its features over time. Since products comprise a set of features with several alternatives for each, design involves complicated decisions: which features to upgrade, what alternatives should be chosen, and when to upgrade. This paper proposes a model to prescribe profitable upgrades of individual features in a family of products. The model integrates decisions traditionally made by various organizations in the enterprise (marketing, product design engineering, process design engineering, production planning and supply chain management). The special structures embedded in the model are identified and decomposition principles are applied to solve large-scale instances of the size and scope encountered in industry. Tests establish computational benchmarks, showing that this decomposition approach outperforms a commercial solver, most dramatically on more challenging instances. The solution obtained by solving the model will aid managers in deciding the content and timing of upgrades to maximize life cycle profit."

Abstract Purpose – To empirically investigate the problems encountered in trying to integrate supply chains in the UK construction industry and to set these problems in the context of the extensive literature on supply chain management and partnering. Design/methodology/approach – A brief review of current supply chain issues in the construction industry is provided. Three case studies of leading construction clients were carried out and these included public and private organisations from different sectors of the economy, public transport, information and communications technology and vehicle manufacturing. A large number of interviews were conducted with the various clients, their main contractors and key subcontractors and suppliers. Findings – The findings reveal that the large number of supply chain partners and the significant level of fragmentation limit the levels of integration that are achievable. The interplay of environmental and procurement related factors renders the realisation of truly integrated supply chains very problematic and difficult to achieve. Nevertheless the paper identifies some key principles that do need to be followed if the elusive goal of integration is to be eventually realised. Research limitations/implications – While the present cases were chosen to be representative, they may not necessarily reflect the experiences of all clients and contractors in the construction industry. Originality/value – This paper adds another dimension to the extensive body of knowledge that already exists on supply chain integration. In particular, it focuses on construction, a large and important sector of the economy but one that does not receive as much research interest as the manufacturing and distribution sectors."

The relationships between theoretical constructs are analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings – This study generates important findings of the significant and positive relationships between iGSCM (internal GSCM, GSCM with customers and GSCM with suppliers) and operational performance in terms of flexibility, delivery, quality and cost. Practical implications – It is important for managers to simultaneously consider internal GSCM and GSCM with customers and suppliers when implementing environmental sustainability in the supply chains. Overlooking either internal GSCM or external GSCM may hinder their efforts to improve operational performance. Originality/value – This study contributes to the literature by defining iGSCM that combines three main dimensions, namely, internal GSCM, GSCM with customers and GSCM with suppliers, and empirically testing its impact on multiple operational performance dimensions."

There is also a strong ambition to standardizes those codes that are not mentioned in the official bending lists. This project has two-part and, follows these objectives: 1. Automate the production of reinforcement, production by direct export from model, avoiding manual work in the form of official bending lists and minimizing incorrect production / deliveries. 2. Reinforcement of cast in site structures by model and avoiding traditional reinforcement drawings on building sites. In this study, current tools' capacities and performance from these prospects is evaluated. The flow work for 3 reinforcements over its data exchange is considered. This process demonstrates the importance of selecting the proper method of extracting outputs from the model, and its influence on the path from modelling to the production section for BIM tools to operational support and perfect the whole reinforcement modelling. BIM tools are considered in four sections: design and modeling; editing, updating and optimization, interoperability, project and construction management. This assessment demonstrates development trends in the BIM software industry according to concrete 3D-reinforcement. It is attempted to simulate a small section of Gol project to get a better understanding of work flow. In this assignment the focus would have be on the workflow and improvement or optimization of this purposes. • Consider how we can standardize the workflow using file formats (excel / BVBS). Pros / Cons of these. • What are the challenges with quality assurance? How to set status on objects? • What parameters must be included in the model? • Which standard views must be included in the production / assembly at the construction site"

The objective of the proposed method is to maximize the technological competencies of the selected suppliers while meeting their capacity constraints. The column generation method resolves the issue of limited scalability of a traditional linear programming formulation and can be integrated into the DMM.

Today fashion industry can be segmented in the following main categories: haute couture, designer wear and street fashion. Most people buy their clothes in the mass market of street fashion. However, fashion companies can offer well-fitting clothing to only 30 to 40% of their target. When addressing new target groups this is often reduced to merely 10%. This stands in stark contrast with the changing demands of the consumers who lose their tolerance for regular products and have become more and more demanding for garments with a personalized style, fit and colour/print. As a result fashion companies miss an enormous potential and there are many obsolete stocks. For coping with this new challenge, fashion industry should shift from a mass production to a mass customization business model. Several new technologies and an optimization of the supply chain organization for diversified products can help mass customization operations. Today the construction of the basic pattern and the grading to other sizes is based solely on 1D body dimensions. The grading is proportional or rational, but never allometric (taking into account the body proportions). Because the actual morphology of the target is not taken into account the result is a poor fit. 3D body scanning technology allows to acquire precise body measurements and a visual model. These results can be used to customize apparel products. 3D prototyping simulation can be used to provide consumers with a personalized try-on illustration. This technology can also offer an advanced 3D designing environment to designers. This feature will largely decrease the number of real prototypes and reduces significantly the time-to-market. Digital printing offers additional personalization and the possibility to co-design."

A model is constructed which encompasses all of these functions and their sub processes for the supply chain and working life of a digital multi-function printer/copier. Environmental data is attached to the model by means of aggregation into three environmental indicators - energy consumption, atmospheric pollution and materials intensity. By developing this model it is possible to prioritise management action to address the environmental effects of supply chain processes. In the supply chain scenario used in this research project, it is found that the working life of the machine at the customer’s premises causes the most environmental impact. In particular, it is the effects caused by the transport used by the service engineer to visit the machine and the paper used which are most significant. The environmental performance model is then incorporated into business planning by establishing a link to an existing business measurement - customer satisfaction. In this way it is possible to integrate the environment into strategic decision-making. Through the application of the model to strategic business planning corporate management teams are now able to consider the environment when they are making decisions about the future of integrated supply chains."

The low-power 2PASCL circuit uses two complementary split-level sinusoidal power supply clocks whose height is equal to Vdd. It can be directly derived from static CMOS circuits. By removing the diode from the charging path, higher output amplitude is achieved and the power consumption of the diode is eliminated. 2PASCL has switching activity that is lower than dynamic logic. We also design and simulate NOT, NAND, NOR, and XOR logic gates on the basis of the 2PASCL topology. From the simulation results, we find that 2PASCL 4-inverter chain logic can save up to 79% of dissipated energy as compared to that with a static CMOS logic at transition frequencies of 1 to 100 MHz.

Abstract Purpose – Ensuring continued compliance with food safety legislation and market requirements is critical to the fresh produce industry. The purpose of this paper is to analyse how a pre-requisite programme (PRP) and key performance indicators (KPI) for food safety can be developed for the production of fresh produce, in both low input and high input supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – The first stage of the research involved an examination of literature, which was conducted using desk research. The second stage includes a review of food safety management systems (FSMS) in fresh produce supply and the development of a PRP/KPI framework. Findings – Farm assurance is well developed in the high input food supply chain for multiple retail customers. However, low input systems such as organic production, or conventional sources are often non-assured, and supply wholesale retail and food service markets. Recent food safety incidents such as the E. coli outbreak in Germany have demonstrated that universally an effective FSMS is critical to ensure that produce is safe and wholesome and is not the cause of a food safety outbreak. Originality/value – This study is of benefit to the produce industry and those in the food supply chain in the further development of quality assurance (QA) standards and business improvement models."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate how food manufacturers in Sweden define and view innovations, how they view their role and those of other actors and the interaction/collaboration regarding innovations in the food supply/value chain. Design/methodology/approach – After an exploratory pre-study with 12 participants, a full study of Swedish manufacturers comprised of representatives from 12 food companies was initiated. In total, 21 interviews were carried out. The majority of the respondents had food industry experience. They initially answered structured questions and thereafter open-ended ones. Findings – Few, if any, innovations in the Swedish food sector are considered radical. Many are "" invisible "" to meet demands for lower cost, shorter orders and sustainability. The food manufacturers seem to develop products in house for consumers and not by working with them or others inside or outside the supply chain; they do not adopt an "" open "" innovation mindset. There is lack of trust in the chain and limited exchange of information. Some manufacturers pursue horizontal collaboration with other manufacturers abroad. Research limitations/implications – Innovations and strategies are a competitive edge for a company, so the respondents may not have been completely open. Practical implications – Manufacturers and the whole supply chain would benefit from an "" open innovation "" mindset to organise and work differently and build trust. Originality/value – There is no other published study on innovations and food manufacturers in Sweden. The food sector should embark on collaboration and coopetion and initiate discussions on what can be done to become more innovative."

The limited studies available indicate that most of the UEEE exported to Africa are hazardous wastes with concentrations of heavy metals several fold higher than permissible levels in developed countries. Crude methods are used in the informal sector to extract precious metals such as gold, silver etc from e-waste; causing the release of heavy metals and environmental multimedia contamination.

We examine whether the boundary condition for ambidextrous learning can be extended from firms to long-term interorganizational relationships. Specifically, we focus on a particular aspect of learning-namely, explorative and exploitative knowledge sharing-and examine its impact on the performance of long-term relationships. We also theorize how ambidextrous management of the relationship and ontological commitment to span the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic knowledge boundaries between partners enable knowledge sharing. Our theoretical predictions are tested using data collected from both account managers at customer firms responsible for the relationship with a leading supply chain vendor and account managers at the vendor firm responsible for relationships with customers. The findings suggest that both exploratory and exploitative knowledge sharing lead to relationship performance gains, that such sharing is enabled by the ambidextrous management of the relationship, and that such sharing is facilitated by ontological commitment. Interesting differences in the enablers and consequences of both forms of knowledge sharing are detected between customers and the vendor. © 2008 INFORMS."

The system uses the child's fingerprint to access their vaccine history and inform health workers as to the appropriate course of treatment. The primary benefit of the system is ensuring that a child receives the appropriate vaccines. The ancillary benefit is the wealth of data about where and when vaccines were administered. This empowers health officials to make more informed decisions, incorporating concepts from demand forecasting, supply chain management, and resource allocation. We are using the transition to a digital system as an opportunity to re-engineer a number of processes, finding ways to improve the efficiency of the vaccine delivery system. Structure/Method/Design: VaxTrac provides the technology, training, and ongoing support to the parties responsible for delivering the health services, be it the Ministry of Health or an NGO. We also serve as a technical advisor on issues related to data-driven decision making in vaccination processes. Results (Scientific Abstract)/Collaborative Partners (Programmatic Abstract): VaxTrac has worked closely with the Benin Ministry of Health in addition to both country and international offices of UNICEF and WHO. We are currently building a consotium with researchers from Emory University School of Public Health and the Benin National University School of Public Health. Summary/Conclusion: The primary success has been the increase in the amount of available information about vaccine administration and the integration of that data into decision-making processes. Streamlining the data input and reporting mechanisms has greatly reduced the administrative burden on frontline health workers, enabling them to spend a larger proportion of their time actually interacting with patients and improve the quality of care. The introduction of technology into the clinic setting has increased mothers' perception of the importance and ""professionalism"" of immunization as a health service, leading to a higher coverage rate and better vaccine schedule adherence."

By using RFID tags it became possible to ?endow? packages, physical assets and other items with uniqueidentities and location awareness thus bringing new efficiencies tothe logistics domain. A decade later, the concept of an ?Internet of Things? has expanded and evolved dramatically. This concept now describes a vision of a fully interconnected world where swarms ofsensors provide real-time information about a vast number of physical and virtual state variables around the world. Theevolution of digital fabrication methods, materials and applications has been influenced by the IoT vision and technologydemands. Innovations focused on new functional inks, flexible andunconventional substrates, low temperature device and circuitfabrication, and roll-to-roll manufacturing are already beingleveraged to produce all-printed RFID tags and antenna, ?smart? labels, ?smart? packaging, and novel sensors fabricated onunconventional surfaces and substrates."

Abstract Purpose – In global scenario, many organizations own supply chains, which operate in different countries. The performance of these supply chains, owned by the same organization must be same if they operate in countries with similar economical, political, and social conditions. In this paper, an effort has been made to propose a methodology for the internal benchmarking to reduce the variability in performance among supply chains of same focal firm. The proposed methodology of internal benchmarking for assessment of supply chain performance demonstrated through a case supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – A case of global supply chains is presented in which a focal firm owns three supply chains operating in three different countries. In order to assess and improve the performance of these supply chains relative to each other, a benchmarking methodology is proposed. Findings – An extensive use of performance value analysis (PVA) and strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis provided good diagnosis of supply chains. This analysis can be very useful in leveraging the supply chain drivers of various supply chains belonging to same focal organization and hence bring performance of all the supply chains at the same performance level. Originality/value – According to the authors' knowledge, there is no paper in the literature, which discusses the application of PVA and SWOT analysis for internal benchmarking in supply chain management and it is believed that it will be useful for supply chain managers to apply such tools to lead global development in their supply chains."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the concept of supply chain collaboration and to provide an overall framework that can be used as a conceptual landmark for further empirical research. In addition, the concept is explored in the context of agri-food industry and particularities are identified. Finally, the paper submits empirical evidence from an exploratory case study in the agri-food industry, at the grower-processor interface, and information regarding the way the concept is actually applied in small medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is presented. Design/methodology/approach – The paper employed case study research by conducting in-depth interviews in the two companies. Findings – Supply chain collaboration concept is of significant importance for the agri-food industry however, some constraints arise due to the nature of industry's products, and the specific structure of the sector. Subsequently, collaboration in the supply chain is often limited to operational issues and to logistics-related activities. Research limitations/implications – Research is limited to a single case study and further qualitative testing of the conceptual model is needed in order to adjust the model before large scale testing. Practical implications – Case study findings may be transferable to other similar dual relationships at the grower-processor interface. Weaker parts in asymmetric relationships have opportunities to improve their position, altering the dependence balance, by achieving product/process excellence. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence regarding the applicability of the supply chain collaboration concept in the agri-food industry. It takes into consideration not relationships between big multinational companies, but SMEs."

We find that cross-border access to online media stores is generally blocked for the products and distributors surveyed in this study, though it can usually be circumvented. By contrast, cross-border availability is high, reaching around 98.6% for e-books on Amazon, 90% for downloadable music on iTunes, and 81.1% and 90.5% respectively for PS3 and PS4 PlayStation games. We could not directly verify cross-border availability of music in streaming services but a small sample test suggests that it could reach around 96% on Spotify. We find that the frequency of cross-country price differentiation is limited for games in the Sony PlayStation stores (less than 4%) but higher for downloadable music in the Apple iTunes stores (11.5%) and Amazon e-book stores (26%). Much of this price differentiation is driven by exchange rates and rounding off prices in country stores not denominated in Euro. In music, price discrimination is used mostly to extract higher prices from high-income consumers and for more popular songs with a lower price elasticity of demand. Subscription prices for main music streaming services are strongly correlated with country per capita income levels. Geographical market differentiation and geo-blocking in digital media is often attributed to the territoriality of the copyright management regime. In most cases rights holders are in a position to issue multi-territorial licenses. For commercial reasons however they may prefer to exercise their rights on a territorial basis. The welfare effect of geo-blocking on sellers can be safely assumed to be positive otherwise sellers would not apply this commercial strategy. The impact on consumer welfare is a-priori ambiguous. Geo-blocking reduces the extent of product variety available to consumers. Whether it increases or reduces consumer welfare is an empirical question. The data required to empirically estimate the impact of (lifting) geo-blocking restrictions on welfare are held by the private platform operators. A future assessment can only be made if the required data on product prices and sales are made available to independent researchers. Lifting geo-blocking restrictions will induce price arbitrage between country markets. That may put pressure on sellers to reduce price differentiation and push some prices up, others down. The price response of sellers is hard to predict and may have repercussions not only on downstream consumers but also on upstream parts of the supply chain. Price convergence is unlikely to be perfect and some differentiation may continue to exist because trade costs between country stores may not fall to zero (exchange rates, means of payment, linguistic trade barriers, etc.)."

The first book ever to focus on the implementation of BIM processes in landscape and external works, BIM for Landscape will help landscape professionals understand what BIM means for them. This book is intended to equip landscape practitioners and practices to meet the challenges and reap the rewards of working in a BIM environment - and to help professionals in related fields to understand how BIM processes can be brought into landscape projects. BIM offers significant benefits to the landscape profession, and heralds a new chapter in inter-disciplinary relationships. BIM for Landscape shows how BIM can enhance collaboration with other professionals and clients, streamline information processes, improve decision-making and deliver well-designed landscape projects that are right first time, on schedule and on budget. This book looks at the organisational, technological and professional practice implications of BIM adoption. It discusses in detail the standards, structures and information processes that form BIM Level 2-compliant workflows, highlighting the role of the landscape professional within the new ways of working that BIM entails. It also looks in depth at the digital tools used in BIM projects, emphasising the 'information' in Building Information Modelling, and the possibilities that data-rich models offer in landscape design, maintenance and management.

A common line of thought is that by acquiring competencies in areas such as predictive analytics and by exploiting Big Data, management accountants can achieve the role of ""business partner,"" assisting in and supporting senior management in strategy formulation, validation, and implementation. Yet others-including those in operations, HR, and marketing-can make similar claims about the ability to offer strategic insights by exploiting the new sources of data available. So what added value do we as management accountants bring to the table? It's that only management accountants can combine a holistic view of operations, mastery of quantitative and technological skills, and a unique understanding of costs-their behavior, their relevance, and their use in decision making. But how well are we management accountants currently serving this role? Unfortunately, not well at all. An IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) study of senior finance professionals found that while 80% believed that the Finance function adds a great deal of value to their organization, only 22% believed that those outside of Finance saw its role as adding a great deal of value (see http://bit.ly/2pd8S8i). is lack of perceived value in the information provided by Finance isn't unfounded. An ongoing survey by IMA's Managerial Costing Task Force of operations and supply chain professionals found that slightly more than half of the respondents believe that their organizations' cost information system fails to provide an accurate assessment of costs for internal decision making. Forty-four percent agree with the statement that ""Our cost information is not helpful to me in my work."" And 83% believe that the benefits of improving their costing systems outweigh the cost of doing so. (See ""IMA's Managerial Costing Task Force"" for more about the task force itself.) ®"

In sub-Saharan Africa, where disease burden is greatest, there are no universal NBS programs and few institutions have the capacity to conduct NBS. Objective(s): To identify barriers and challenges in implementing universal NBS for SCD at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Ghana's largest public hospital. Design/Method: The SCD NBS program at KBTH is a multiphase partnership between the hospital and the SickKids Centre for Global Child Health, Toronto. The goal of the 6-month pilot phase (June to December 2017) was to screen 4,000 babies born in KBTH and enrol babies with possible SCD (P-SCD) into the pediatric SCD clinic for follow up care. A dedicated NBS program coordinator was hired and public health nurses and midwives were trained on dried blood spot sampling (DBS) techniques. Testing of blood samples using isoelectric focusing was performed at an off-site, national research laboratory. A stakeholder dissemination meeting was held in August 2018 following completion of the pilot phase. Result(s): Although planned for 6 months, the pilot phase was completed in 13 months (June 2017 to July 2018). One hundred and five public health nurses and midwives acquired competency in DBS. Out of 10,211 live births, only 4,527 babies (44.3%) were screened. Of these, 79 (1.8%) were identified with P-SCD and 70 (88.6%) were successfully contacted. Eighteen dedicated newborn clinics were held and babies with P-SCD commenced penicillin prophylaxis. Four major challenges were identified: 1) Inadequate nursing staff to perform screening, 2) Intermittent shortage of screening supplies, 3) Delays in receiving screening results, and 4) Lack of clinic space and nurses to accommodate the increased patient enrolment. Strategies to overcome these challenges were discussed at the dissemination meeting and lessons learned will be incorporated into the next phase. These include the launch of an innovative, integrated hospital discharge process for all newborns, advocating for increased staffing on the maternity wards, improved supply chain management, use of a novel digital mobile application for receiving laboratory results, and hiring dedicated newborn clinic nurses. Conclusion(s): The pilot phase of NBS for SCD in KBTH presented challenges which have implications on achieving and sustaining universal screening for babies born in the hospital. In the next phase of the program, these challenges will be addressed to build on the modest initial gains."

Society would benefit from a clear understanding of the contemporary state of technology readiness and adoption, and their converging impact and value on the factory floor, firms, industries, society. Scholars demonstrated that technology, innovation and knowledge play a significant role in value creation. Even though few research has been carried out, no studies have been found explaining how owners would manage innovation and knowledge vision and turning them successfully into organizational performance by creating values. Therefore, in this paper the authors are stating about the research problem of not understanding the process. Knowledge is that which is known, by its very nature it depends on thought and it is also transferred by thought, thought and behaviour both based on values. Transfer of knowledge is understood as moving of knowledge from lower to higher agency levels in explicit or tacit form. Moreover, the innovation lens captures the perspective of value creation. The main purpose to develop a better understanding has reached, also a view towards generating discussion and debate in this important research area. Practically in order to transfer knowledge there is a need for proficient owners. A future development will be a cross-national research, involving action research strategy which offers a unique opportunity to bridge the large and growing divide between the vast majority of research that is conducted and the usefulness of that research for organizations."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review a sample of the literature relating to the integration and implementation of supply chain management practices from a strategic viewpoint. Design/methodology/approach – The literature is examined from three perspectives. First, supply chain integration covers issues relating to integration of core processes across organizational boundaries through improved communication, partnerships, alliances and cooperation. Second, strategy and planning examines supply chain management as a strategic matter for trading partners, along with factors relating to the amount of planning required. Third, implementation issues concern factors critical for successful implementation, as well as issues specific to inter and intra-organizational aspects of supply chain initiatives are contained in this sub-group Findings – An important emergent theme from the literature is the importance of taking a holistic view, and the systemic nature of interactions between the participants. At the same time, it is also apparent that this requirement to take such an holistic and systemic view of the supply chain acts as an impediment to more extensive implementation. The strategic nature of adopting a supply chain wide perspective, on the one hand provides significant potential benefit, and on the other requires trading partners to think and act strategically. This is easier said than done within a stand-alone organization, let alone across a diverse and dispersed group of trading partners. Research limitations/implications – The scope of this review is by design limited to a cross-section of the literature in this area. As such, it cannot, and does not, attempt to be an examination of the full range of the literature, but a sampling of important and influential works. Practical implications – This review of the literature serves to highlight the inter-dependence between integration (technologies, logistics, and partnerships), a strategic view of supply chain systems, and implementation approach. All three need to inform and underpin each other in order for management of supply chains to be able to deliver on the promise of benefits for all trading partners. Originality/value – This study reviews a sample of recent and classic literature in this field, and in doing so provides some clear guidelines for the conduct of future research."

It dissects the nexus of social, economic, environmental and governance crises confronting us, and a series of colliding megatrends with the potential to reshape opportunities for growth. Three cities of the future are emerging. The first is Petropolis, the alluringly familiar but decreasingly resilient city, locked into the century old technologies of fossil fuel-driven mass production. This is the city of rising inequality, credit-fuelled consumption, offshored jobs, climate volatility, and unsustainable household and national debt. The second city is Cyburbia. This is mass production on the steroids of IT: the latest manifestation of science fictions city without pain, but one inhabited by voice-activated popcorn dispensers, of athletics'shoes with in-built Twitter feeds, of sensor-packed and censoring glass towers that risk reducing their citizens to digital factors of production in the supply chain of big data. The third is the Distributed City, where technology is deployed with the intent to connect us not virtually but physically—from Nairobi's network of innovation spaces to Hamburg's Participatory Budgeting experiments, from Barcelona's network for micro-manufacturing, to Austin's distributed smart grid. These are the cities of society's future, and they have very different implications for business success, and our ability to navigate the social, economic, and environmental megatrends that confront us.

Operated by access networks and other operators, they provide benefits to content publishers in the forms of bandwidth cost reduction, response time improvement, and handling of flash crowds. Yet, caching has not been fully embraced by publishers, because its use can interfere with site personalization strategies and/or collection of visitor information for business intelligence purposes. While recent work has focused on technological solutions to these issues, this paper provides the first study of the managerial issues related to the design and provisioning of incentive-compatible caching services. Starting with a single class of caching service, we find conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should offer the service for free. This occurs when the access networks' bandwidth costs are high and a large fraction of content publishers value personalization and business intelligence. Some publishers will still opt out of the service, i.e., cache bust, as observed in practice. We next derive the conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should provision two vertically differentiated service classes, namely, premium and best effort. Interestingly, caching service differentiation is different from traditional vertical differentiation models, in that the premium and best-effort market segments do not abut. Thus, optimal prices for the two service classes can be set independently and cannibalization does not occur. It is possible for the cache operator to continue to offer the best-effort service for free while charging for the premium service. Furthermore, consumers are better off because more content is cached and delivered faster to them. Finally, we find that declining bandwidth costs will put negative pressure on cache operator profits, unless consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the availability of multimedia content provide the necessary increase in traffic volume for the caches. © 2005 INFORMS."

By recruiting participants from many industries and levels of seniority, it complements the predominantly organisation-level, top-down perspectives within extant IM literature, emancipating the voices of previously underrepresented actors. The study is intended to address recent calls for exploration of dyadic perspectives within IM research (Yang & Coates, 2010), and assess the applicability of key concepts from Channel Management (CM) literature, transposing them from the supply chain into an internal market context. It therefore explores the tacit, informal, unplanned, undocumented and often interpersonal transactions through which IM takes place, and may be considered relativistic, phenomenological and postmodernist in its concerns. An emergent concept is the phenomenon of Internal Demarketing (ID), in which accepted marketing strategies and techniques applied to the internal market reduce the attractiveness of the organisation to some or all staff. It is proposed that this may occur as an intentional, covert strategy, possibly with sub-strategies tailored to different organisational objectives and employee segments. These are taxonomized here. This qualitative thesis makes a methodological contribution by introducing a new form of member checking (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) in which participants prepare for interview by reflecting upon their own online and digital communications about the research topic, using that reflexivity to steer interviews and corroborate or challenge and amend the researcher's subsequent analysis of those interviews."

Compared with conventional manufacturing techniques, AM exhibits many unique advantages, including short supply chain, on-site and on-demand manufacturing of spare units and tools, short design-to-market, less consumption of energy, and less generation of material waste. More importantly, AM almost eliminates tooling constraints, giving us the much-needed freedom to design and build parts with complex geometries and improved performance. Nowadays, there are tens of different AM technologies, which we can categorize into seven families: powder bed fusion, direct energy deposition, binder jetting, material jetting, sheet lamination, vat polymerization, material extrusion, and hybrid. Among all, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is the most extensively used technique for 3D printing metals, and has found many applications in the fields of biomedical, aerospace, automobile, and defense. Owing to substantial investments in the technology from both public and private groups worldwide, LPBF has developed rapidly in the last three decades. Numerous 3D printer manufacturers have emerged, and the technique maturation was seemingly reached. LPBF is a conceptually simple process, but the thermal conditions involved are rather extreme. The local temperature is generally higher than the boiling point of the metal being processed. Meanwhile, the heating and cooling rates are in the order of 10 6 K/s, and the thermal gradient can easily reach 10 3 K/mm. Given such extreme thermal condition, many highly dynamic and transient physical processes are involved in LPBF. Their complex interplay often leads to structure defects in the build, including but not limited to rough surface, porosity, cracks, residual stress, and undesired phase and grain structures. Therefore, no matter how good the machine design and engineering control are, the success rate of printing a complex part in the first round of attempt remains low. Operator's experience may help identify the initial processing window, but the trial-and-error type effort to further optimize the processing condition is often inevitable. Computer simulation can also help narrow the range of laser parameters for a given material and part geometry. However, most of current LPBF process models are based on indirect observations or post-mortem characterization results, and even the most sophisticated 3D multi-physics models are developed with major assumptions. At the Advanced Photon Source of Argonne National Laboratory, we recently developed and applied high-speed x-ray imaging technique for in situ studying LPBF processes. (Fig.1) The LPBF simulator consists of a 1070 nm ytterbium fiber laser source, a galvanometer laser scanner, a vacuum chamber, and two sets of stepping motors.

Abstract Purpose – This conceptual paper aims to examine the notion that supply chain integration is an extension and application of vertical integration theory. Design/methodology/approach – The paper initially defines a foundation in the supply chain and vertical integration literature, with particular attention to the seminal works of Harrigan in vertical integration and Hayes and Wheelwright in product life cycles. The paper then offers an assessment of the state of the supply chain integration literature. Subsequently, the stage of product/process life cycle and environmental variables such as complexity and munificence are examined in detail and are the basis for the theoretical model and propositions. Findings – This study argues that the stage of life cycle variables is associated with the various dimensions of supply chain integration, and that environmental complexity and munificence have significant moderating effects on the relationships. The paper posits that, for efficiency and success, a strategic fit must exist between environmental, strategic and operations variables, and that specific dimensions of integrative effort are appropriate for given situations. That fit would attenuate bullwhip inefficiencies, either of inventories and other mechanical decisions, or of the less tangible human and structural interaction. Originality/value – As such, this paper represents a cross-functional and interdisciplinary approach to operations and strategic management theory by identifying and facilitating appropriate operations decisions pertaining to the contingencies of the supply chain."

Abstract This paper will provide an introduction to the argument that there is considerable evidence of poor thinking within the construction industry. The failure to understand the circumstances that are facing industry players will prevent clients, contractors and suppliers from achieving their own objectives. The current problems are further compounded by the advice espoused by the government-sponsored industry reports advocating generic approaches. In response to these problems the paper will provide practitioners with a theoretical framework for understanding: the structure of the industry and its constituent supply chains; the attributes of buyer and supplier power; the appropriateness of certain relationships according to the firm's power position within the construction supply chain; and, the circumstances where the recent industry initiatives and an integrated supply chain approach may be implemented with success."

Abstract Purpose – The desire to cut supply chain costs has made RFID technology one of today's most discussed retail technologies. Given the current implementation pace, the objective of this paper is to go beyond the hype and explore basic issues related to RFID technology, including its promises as well as its pitfalls. Design/methodology/approach – The author provides a conceptual discussion of the evolution of RFID, addresses its capabilities and its application in various industries, discusses implementation challenges, identifies adoption phases, and reviews RFID's success factors. Findings – RFID is the most recent prolific technology that provides supply chain collaboration and visibility. An RFID systems solution will increase corporate ROI while at the same time improving retail supply chain communication. Handled properly, RFID technology can result in an evolutionary change incorporating legacy systems with the real-time supply chain management of tomorrow. Its stumbling point seems only to be a variety of issues outside the technology itself: marketing problems, false promises, security and privacy considerations, and a lack of standards. Research limitations/implications – The paper was constrained by empirical evidence of, for example, technology deployment, adoption drivers, and success factors. Practical implications – The paper confirms the power of RFID – a technology in its infancy with as yet untapped potential for supply chain collaboration. It also examines some of the popular RFID products and services. Originality/value – The paper discusses implementation challenges, identifies adoption phases, and reviews RFID's success factors. It identifies the biggest implementation challenge as the challenge for IT experts of determining how to integrate RFID with existing supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications."

The hearing impaired typically experience more frustration, anxiety, irritability, depression, and disorientation than those with normal hearing levels. The standard rehabilitation tool for hearing impairment is an electronic hearing aid whose main components are transducers (microphone and receiver) and a digital signal processor. These electronic components are manufactured by supply chain rather than by hearing aid manufacturers. Manufacturers can use custom-designed components or generic off-the-shelf components. These electronic components are available as application-specific or off-the-shelf products, with the former designed for a specific manufacturer and the latter for a generic approach. The choice of custom or generic components will affect the product specifications, pricing, manufacturing, life cycle, and marketing strategies of the product. The World Health Organization is interested in making available to developing countries hearing aids that are inexpensive to purchase and maintain. The hearing aid presented in this article was developed with these specifications in mind together with additional contemporary features such as four channels with wide dynamic range compression, an adjustable compression rate for each channel, four comfort programs, an adaptive feedback manager, and full volume control. This digital hearing aid is fitted using a personal computer with minimal hardware requirements in intuitive three-step fitting software. A trimmer-adjusted version can be developed where human and material resources are scarce."

However, implementations of such systems have tended to be problematic. ERP projects, in particular, are prone to cost and time overruns, not delivering anticipated benefits and often being abandoned before completion. While research has developed around IT implementation, this has focused mainly on standalone (or discrete), as opposed to integrated, IT systems. Within this literature, organisational (i.e., structural and cultural) characteristics have been found to influence implementation success. The key aims of this research are (a) to investigate the role of organisational characteristics in determining IT implementation success; (b) to determine whether their influence differs for integrated IT and discrete IT projects; and (c) to develop specific guidelines for managers of integrated IT implementations. An in-depth comparative case study of two IT projects was conducted within a major aerospace manufacturing company."

It is targeted to small and medium-sized companies, with limited financial means for investments and without technical support in their premises. These requirements are met by using a personal digital assistant (PDA) equipped with an radio frequency identification (RFID) reader: the information collected throughout the production process are locally stored in the PDA and occasionally sent to a server. In this way the proposed system does not rely neither on a widespread wireless network, nor on fixed RFID readers, which can increase automation, but need more investment and assistance."

The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of digitisation on procurement and its role within the area of supply chain management. The research will also explore potential barriers to digitising procurement and supply chains and ways to overcome them. Finally, the significance of potential enabling technologies to the digitisation will also be examined. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approached utilising an online survey was used to collect the primary data for this study. Data were collected from 414 participants directly involved with procurement or related business functions and work for different organisations in different industries. The survey included eight items about the impact of digitisation on organisational performance in the area of procurement and supply chains; ten items related to key barriers to digitisation of organisations and ways to overcome them; and seven items about enabling technologies to leverage procurement procedures and processes digitisation. All of these items utilised the Likert five-point level of agreement scale. Findings: The findings indicate that digitisation of procurement process can yield several benefits including: supporting daily business and administrative tasks, supporting complex decision-making processes, procurement will become more focussed on strategic decisions and activities, procurement will become a strategic interface to support organisational efficiency, effectiveness, and profitability, and supporting the creation of new business models, products, and services. The authors were also able to confirm that there are barriers to digitising procurement process and supply chains and such barriers found in existing procedures, processes, capacities, and capabilities. Finally, the significance of a number of enabling technologies to the digitisation process was revealed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study of its kind with participants located world-wide. Industry 4.0 as a topic had been explored within different business areas and functions but very limited research specifically explored potential impact, barriers, and enabling technologies of procurement 4.0.

Industry attempts to measure working conditions have shown bias and inconsistency, and there is no consensus on what to measure, or how. Well-being can be intangible and difficult to capture without appropriate theoretical and methodological frameworks. This paper investigates factors influencing the well-being of a Chinese factory’s workers, tests an innovative research method, and proposes interventions to improve well-being in factories. Design/methodology/approach: This is a longitudinal study using the diaries of production workers at a large assembly manufacturing site in China. Workers left daily digital voice diaries about their day, which were analysed to identify factors related to their well-being at work. Findings: The picture is more complex than the concerned Western narrative suggests. Workers’ personal and professional concerns extend beyond the criteria currently measured in audits, tending to be more relational and less about their physical state. Practical implications: The current approach of auditing management practices neglects workers’ well-being. This study offers a more comprehensive view of well-being and tests a new method of investigation. Originality/value: This is the first study to use diary methods in a Chinese factory. It addresses an issue supported by little empirical evidence. It is the first longitudinal study to hear from factory workers themselves about how they are and what impacts their well-being daily."

Pulse expansion is achieved using an all-digital pulse-mixing scheme that can effectively improve the timing resolution and enable the DTC to be concise. Without requiring the Vernier principle or a costly digital-to-analog converter, the DTC comprises a pulse generator for generating a pulse, a pulse-expanding circuit (PEC) for programming timing generation, and a time subtractor for removing the time width of the pulse. The PEC comprises only a delay chain composed of proposed pulse-expanding units and a multiplexer. For accuracy enhancement, a pulse neutralization technique is presented to eliminate undesirable pulse variation. A 4-bit converter was fabricated in a 0.35-μm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company CMOS process and had a small area of nearly 0.045 mm2. Six chips were tested, all of which exhibited an improved resolution (approximately 16 ps) and low integral nonlinearity (less than ±0.4 least significant bit). The power consumption was 0.2 mW when the sample rate was 1M samples/s and the voltage supply was 3.3 V. The proposed DTC not only has favorable cost and power but also achieves an acceptable resolution without requiring an advanced CMOS process.

Scan-cell reordering (SCR) is a popular technique to reduce test energy consumption. Conventional SCR techniques use the number of toggles in the scan flip-flops as cost criteria for reordering. The energy consumed during the scan test cycles includes that consumed by the logic and that consumed by the scan-chain. Interconnects contribute to more than 50% of the scan-chain energy consumption. Motivated by this, the paper proposes an SCR technique that uses the wire capacitances, in addition to the toggle criteria to perform the reordering. Results obtained by employing the technique on ISCAS89 benchmarks and OpenCores show a reduction in total scan-shift energy of up to 32% and a 11 × reduction in total scan-chain wire length. It is interesting to note that just applying the SCR without considering the interconnect capacitances may lead to increase in scan-chain energy consumption in some cases. Additionally, we observe that a significant portion of the total scan-shift power comes from the first-level capacitance, contributed by both interconnects and input capacitances of gates at the first level of logic. Using this, we show that first level capacitance gating, which gates this switching capacitances of the flop-logic interconnect and first-level gates during scan-shift saves power significantly over first-level supply gating. Combining the above two methods, when applied to ISCAS89 and OpenCores benchmark circuits, we get 62% total scan-shift energy savings with a delay penalty of 3%, on the average on the functional performance of the circuit, compared to the best known algorithm.

Abstract Purpose-This paper provides a structured literature review of sustainability in purchasing and supply management, moving beyond the traditional environmental and social sustainability. The paper reviews the concept of sustainability at three levels of inter-organizational analysis-i.e. dyad, supply chain and network. The paper distils the nature and scope of existing research and synthesizes measures used to research sustainability across organizational boundaries. Design/methodology/approach-This literature review systematically analyzes existing literature. In particular, the review focuses on definitions and measures of sustainable purchasing and supply management to obtain an accurate view of current research. Findings-This paper uncovers two distinct trends in the type of research carried out. First, internal or dyadic issues are in focus and second, a tendency to deal with environmental, as opposed to social, sustainability. Despite the need to look beyond the dyad given the risks associated with the extended network, few studies do so in any of the sustainability dimensions. Research limitations/implications-This review is limited by the method employed focusing on definitions and measures. Although the review considers supply chain and network research, it does so purely from a purchasing perspective, thus excluding issues such as logistics and transport. Practical implications-The paper identifies areas open to future research and provides practical insights into how sustainable purchasing and supply are measured. It also synthesizes existing measures of sustainability at different levels and organizes these into a taxonomy. Originality/value-The paper examines studies across multiple levels of analysis and integrates multiple fields of knowledge to show how research on sustainability in purchasing and supply is structured."

This paper seeks to address this gap in the extant knowledge through empirical research in a UK setting. It examines the level of usage, the uses, the perceived benefits, and future perspective on the use, of web-based technology in purchasing and SM. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical survey of UK-based organisations was undertaken. Information simultaneously collected on the buyer-supplier relationship orientation of the firms in the sample was used to test the proposition that the use of web-based technology leads to stronger collaborative relationships with suppliers. Findings - Data obtained from 156 valid responses indicated that six in every ten organisations use web-based technology to support purchasing and SM activities, but that the usage is lower in small to medium-sized enterprises. The main uses reported are for communicating with suppliers, for marketing products/services, and for locating technical data. Making purchases over the internet was significantly more prevalent in organisations exhibiting relatively more partnership orientation. Practical implications - The findings provide only limited evidence in support of the proposition that the deployment of web-based technology leads to stronger buyer-supplier relations. However, findings do suggest that the effectiveness of the purchasing and supply function can be enhanced through greater use of web-based technology for online purchasing and for efficient consumer response. Originality/value - The paper establishes salient UK managerial perception on the strategic and operational importance of web-based technology adoption in purchasing and SM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

The two-stage MASH DSM utilizes the second-order chain of cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF) and the cascade of integrators with distributed feedback (CIFB) architectures for the first and second stages, respectively. The 4-bit CIFF requires an active adder, which is conventionally implemented with a high-bandwidth high-swing amplifier. In the proposed DSM, the active adder is eliminated and the adder-less integrator is applied in the first stage of the MASH DSM. The first stage quantization noise, which is fed to the second stage, is conventionally extracted from the analog input and digital output of the quantizer in the first stage. The number of quantizer digital output paths increases exponentially with the quantization bit number. A large number of DAC feedback paths in the interstage is avoided by proposing a new interstage topology based on analog summing to derive the first stage quantization noise in the analog domain. The prototype DSM is fabricated in a 0.11-$$\upmu$$μm CMOS process. When operating from a 1.2-V supply, the modulator achieves 67.8-dB peak SNDR, while consuming 25 mW, with an OSR of 8 at a 160-MHz sampling frequency."

The construction industry is expected to adopt new methods and strategies to address such requirements, focusing primarily on reducing energy demand, improving process efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. However, the realisation of these emerging requirements has been constrained by the highly fragmented nature of the industry, which is often portrayed as involving a culture of adversarial relationships and risk avoidance, which is exacerbated by a linear workflow. Recurring problems include low process efficiency, delays and construction waste. Building information modelling (BIM) provides a unique opportunity to enhance building energy efficiency (EE) and to open new pathways towards a more digitalised industry and society. BIM has the potential to reduce (a) waste and carbon emissions, (b) the endemic performance gap, (c) in-use energy and (d) the total lifecycle impact. BIM also targets to improve the whole supply chain related to the design, construction as well as the management and use of the facility. However, the construction workforce is required to upgrade their skills and competencies to satisfy new requirements for delivering BIM for EE. Currently, there is a real gap between the industry expectations for employees and current training and educational programmes. There is also a set of new requirements and expectations that the construction industry needs to identify and address in order to deliver more informed BIM for EE practices. This paper provides an in-depth analysis and gap identification pertaining to the skills and competencies involved in BIM training for EE. Consultations and interviews have been used as a method to collect requirements, and a portfolio of use cases have been created and analysed to better understand existing BIM practices and to determine current limitations and gaps in BIM training. The results show that BIM can contribute to the digitalisation of the construction industry in Europe with adapted BIM training and educational programmes to deliver more informed and adapted energy strategies."

Edward Feitzinger and Hau Lee show how the Hewlett-Packard Company and others have proved that one indeed can deliver customized products quickly and at a low cost. The key to mass-customizing effectively is postponing the task of differentiating a product for a specific customer until the latest possible point in the supply network (a company's supply, manufacturing, and distribution chain). Instead of taking a piecemeal approach, companies must rethink and integrate the designs of their products, the processes used to make and deliver those products, and the configuration of their entire supply network. By adopting such a comprehensive approach, they can operate at maximum efficiency and quickly meet customers' orders with a minimum amount of inventory. Three organizational design principles together form the basic building blocks of an effective mass-customization program. First, a product should be designed so that it consists of independent modules that can be assembled into different forms of the product easily and inexpensively. Second, manufacturing processes should be designed so that they, too, consist of independent modules that can be moved or rearranged easily. Third, the supply network should be designed to supply the basic product to the facilities performing the customization in a cost-effective manner. It should have the flexibility and responsiveness to take individual orders and deliver the finished, customized goods quickly.

Some of the economics of the dispersed vision are explored, and perspectives are presented on both the choice of homogeneous universal power quality upstream in the electricity supply chain and on the extremely heterogeneous requirements of end-use loads. It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid. Finally, the potential role of microgrids in delivering heterogeneous power quality is demonstrated by reference to two ongoing microgrid tests in the U.S. and Japan."

The right to food is a fundamental right of humans. With increasing population and urbanization, less land is being used for agricultural purposes. In addition, the climate change due to global warming often leads to frequent disasters such as droughts and floods, adversely affecting the food production. This leads to increased levels of poverty and hunger. Ensuring food security has become the prime agenda for all the policymakers and government bodies across the world. With changing global dynamics, traditional ways of ensuring food security will not be sufficient alone. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need to develop a sustainable food security system that not only focusses on food production but also equally emphasizes on the efficacy of food distribution and reducing food wastage. In this digital age, the emerging disruptive technologies like Block chain, robotics, big data analytics, and cloud computations, etc., are increasingly changing the functioning of various sectors, giving rise to IoT-based working environment. The policymakers are also exploring these technologies to maximize their outreach so as to benefit the larger set of population and to gain visualization and control over policy implementation using IoT. This paper attempts to model the sustainable food security system using various technologies driving IoT. It also studies the interrelationship among various technologies and their application in various levels of policy implementation. The methodology used in the paper is fuzzy-TISM, which not only provides the causal relationship among two technologies but also provides the magnitude of the cause‒effect relationship and the hierarchical framework for the complex problem. Findings: The paper is addressed to the design of sustainable food security system in the Indian context wherein government ensures food security for all, using public distribution system (PDS). Social implications: The paper is addressed to the design of sustainable food security system in Indian context wherein government ensures food security for all, using PDS. Originality/value: This study is a novel attempt to integrate the IoT into the design of the PDS to ensure food security. The enabling factors for IOT are modelled using Fuzzy-TISM."

The first application of this technology is sequencing DNA. The device leverages decades of semiconductor technology advances, and in just a few years has brought the entire design, fabrication and supply chain infrastructure of that industry-a trillion dollar investment-to bear on the challenge of sequencing. The result is Ion semiconductor sequencing, the first commercial sequencing technology that does not use light, and as a result delivers unprecedented speed, scalability and low cost. All of these benefits are a result of applying a technology that is massively scalable, as proven by Moore's Law, to a task that has traditionally used optics-based solutions, which work in a linear fashion: increasing capacity requires increasing the number of signals that must be read resulting in longer run times, higher capital costs and ever more sophisticated optics. By contrast, Ion Torrent semiconductor technology can provide increases in chip capacity without impacting capital costs or runtime. Ion Torrent sequencing uses only natural (label-free) reagents and takes place in Ion semiconductor microchips that contain sensors which have been fabricated as individual electronic detectors, allowing one sequence read per sensor. We will show how the technology has scaled in just a few months from ∼1 million sensors in the first-generation Ion 314 chips to ∼7 million sensors in the second-generation Ion 316 chips-all while maintaining the same 1- to 2-hour runtime. We will also demonstrate that Ion semiconductor sequencing provides exceptional accuracy, long read length and scalability on a single, affordable bench top sequencing platform."

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims to analyze how organizational conditions, technology adoption, supplier relationship management and customer relationship management affect knowledge creation through socialization-externalization combination, internalization (SECI) modes, and various ba, as proposed by Nonaka and Konno, in a supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative inquiry with thematic analysis, which focuses on a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panel manufacturer and an integrated circuits (IC) packaging and testing manufacturer, is presented in order to identify how these key factors affect knowledge creation in a supply chain environment through the SECI modes and ba. Findings – The results show that these critical factors facilitate different types of knowledge conversion process in order to achieve successful knowledge creation in a supply chain. Knowledge of the significant factors that were found in this study may be applicable to countries or areas such as Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore or other developing countries, whose dominant businesses are similar to the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)/ original design manufacturers (ODMs) in Taiwan. Research limitations/implications – This paper considers the case study only as one empirical illustration of many other possible implementation processes. The study does not assume that these companies are a paradigm or that the specific situation is applicable to all other business enterprises. Future researchers interested in this field are therefore encouraged to triangulate its findings by examining variables generated from this study. Originality/value – This study employs a quantitative approach to investigate critical knowledge creation factors for supply chain performance. Through empirical study, a better understanding of the dynamics of knowledge creation in a supply chain can be gained."

Where before this period, lawyers might spend hours researching what we now understand to be a simple question-like whether a particular case has been cited, overturned, or distinguished-they can now get an answer with a click of a mouse. Searching terms in digital files can take minutes, replacing weeks in a warehouse poring through boxes containing reams and reams of paper. And while just fifty years ago lawyers faced significant barriers to advertising, today web and mobile applications connect lawyers with clients in real time, even on the side of the road, as those clients and prospective clients might face a breathalyzer test or the suspicious gaze of a state trooper. Technology is thus changing the practice of law, at times dramatically. It is safe to say that the legal profession is at the cusp of a disruption: a transformative shift that will likely change the practice of law in the United States for the foreseeable future, if not forever. This shift has profound impacts on not just the legal profession, but also on clients as well as the broader society. This Paper explores the nature of this transformative shift and its implications for the legal community and the clients that are presently served by it, as well as those who might be served in the future. It argues that what this transformative shift may do, more than anything else, is improve access to justice in communities not traditionally served by lawyers and the law. In addition, as the following discussion shows, the central disruption that appears to be taking place in the legal profession is not technology itself, but what technology provides: namely, a means for those providing legal services to streamline the delivery of those services in a fashion that is far less expensive than the manner in which such services have been provided to date. Thus, what I identify here is where nnovation appears to be occurring in the delivery of legal services: that is, innovations in the ""supply chain"" of legal services, and these are the innovations that may embody the coming disruption"

They are meant to progress these disciplines by providing a theoretical basis to the field. Next to theories as for instance the resource based view, the resource dependency theory, the transaction cost economics or the agency theory, the network theory has been put on the agenda of researchers. The network theory describes the relationships between companies located in the same supply chain. The concept developed over time from the simple consideration of relationships or strategic alliances between just two companies, towards the explanation of relationships between several counterparts within a supply network, are they suppliers, organisations, buyers, customers or manufacturers. However, no clear consensus have emerged in the field of the contribution of the theory towards supply management and purchasing yet. Therefore, this literature review aims to provide insight in the applicability of the network theory for supply management and purchasing. Besides describing general facts about the theory, namely the history, the underlying assumptions, the description of an empirical test retrieved from the literature, a core concept of the theory is developed in order to provide insight in the most important hypotheses and variables of the theory. These factors helped to reveal the contribution of the theory for purchasing and supply management. For this, a 3-phase model including four major decision points for purchasers was developed to show the applicability of the theory for each aspect. Lastly, a matrix was developed in order to create an overview of the most important contributions which can be used by managers and purchasers interested in the field of networks in supply management."

How can Brazil’s economy escape its inward focus, and become more internationally competitive? How can Brazil increase exports of technology- and knowledge-intensive products and services? An obvious place to look for answers is innovation, and our research specifically asks how the new SENAI Innovation Institutes (ISIs) can emerge as test-beds for new ideas about how to organize and structure innovation projects to help private industry in Brazil become more internationally engaged and competitive. Based on three in-depth the industry studies, Biopharmaceuticals, ICT, and Oil & Gas, we recommend the ISI’s take on an “innovation partner” role, mainly with small and medium-size businesses, in two areas: 1) supplier upgrading, where smaller firms are brought into the innovation system in ways that meets the requirements laid out by larger global suppliers and lead firms downstream in the supply chain; and 2) platform innovation, where smaller firms are helped to develop their own products and services by accessing and learning how to build on global technology platforms in ways that meet the emerging standards of the “digital economy” as embodied by concepts such as Manufacturing 4.0."

However, the relationship of fertilizer application and the safety of agricultural products and ecological environment have aroused wide concern. How to find a balance between improving fertilizer benefit and reducing fertilizer application to ensure environmental safety has become an important problem for fertilizer application. For them, the main way is efficient fertilization. This paper expounds the connotation of efficient fertilization, and considers that efficient fertilization needs to be understood from four aspects: efficiency for grain products, efficiency for production, efficiency for resource and efficiency for environment. Efficient fertilization can be defined as, in every link of crop nutrient supply, the use of modern technical means to maximize the efficiency of fertilizer utilization so as to ensure the improvement of crop yield and quality, reduce the waste of resources and protect the ecological environment. This paper introduces in detail several kinds of efficient fertilization techniques which have been widely used in worldwide, such as soil testing and fertilizer recommendation, precision fertilization, fertigation technology, simple and labor saving fertilization. In the field of soil testing and fertilizer recommendation, this paper introduces the current application of this technique in the United States and Europe, and also introduces the situation of soil testing fertilizer recommendation in China since the 1970s. In the field of precision fertilization, this paper introduces its theory, core technology, development process and the technical ways to realize it, and analyzes the economic benefits of precision agriculture and its application in worldwide. In the field of fertigation, the advantages, pattern, and research process of fertigation are introduced, and emphatically introduced the surface fertigation technology, drip fertigation technology and micro-spraying fertigation technology. The paper put forward that in the foreseeable future, efficient fertilization will be developing towards to information, automation, intelligence and simplification, in particular, it is necessary to carry out in-depth research on efficiency nutrition diagnosis technology, digital nutrient management system and nutrient efficient gene screening, and we also should pay attention to research the integrated management of nutrition chain and the crop nutrition regulation technology."

This infrastructure also helps to improve logistics performance by coupling an RFID chip with the Datamatrix; similarly, by associating an NFC chip with the Datamatrix, the box is opened up to new uses that will allow actors to interact with one another from one end of the logistics chain to the other."

No matter the amount of research that has been done, there is an unfulfilled void between the unresolved points of perception.In fact, the younger generation does not yet have the capacity to clarify the solutions offered throughout the shortest time to come in people's lives. The perspective of this study is to analyse the relation amid tolerance attitude, supply chain management system, ethical values and religion intolerance with the mediation effect of cultural appreciation. The purpose of this analysis is to critically examine and inspect awareness in order to find the latest solutions to problems created by the outbursts of the new multifaceted conflicts. The results of this study suggest that students tend to rise their religious tolerance through understanding the nature of religious tolerance in Islamic teachings characterized in history by the Prophet Muhammad (Reconciliation Peace and blessings Him).Some other students are prejudice to religion as they are more likely to be religious solely with a legal-style philosophy that prefers only liberal or conservative alternatives over the facts.Such results show that students are usually able to understand good religious understanding during course of an investigation as they understand the real presence of Islam in different religious communities.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on the use of mobile technologies to facilitate customers’ shopping in physical retail stores and associated implementation challenges. Design/methodology/approach: First, the authors introduce three emerging mobile shopping checkout processes in the retail store. Second, the authors suggest that new validation procedures (i.e. exit inspections) necessary for implementation of mobile-technology-enabled checkout processes may disrupt traditional retail service processes. The authors propose a construct labeled “tolerance for validation” defined as customer reactions to checkout procedures. The authors define and discuss five dimensions – tolerance for: unfair process; changes in validation process; inconvenience; mistrust; and privacy intrusion. The authors develop a measurement scale for the proposed construct and conduct a study among 239 customers. Findings: The results show that customers have higher tolerance for validation under scenarios in which mobile technologies are used in the checkout processes, as compared to the traditional self-service scenario in which no mobile technology is used. In particular, the customers do not show a clear preference for specific mobile shopping scenarios. Originality/value: These findings contribute to our understanding of a challenge that omnichannel businesses may face as they leverage data from digital technologies to enhance collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment processes. The proposed construct and measurement scales can be used in future work on omnichannel retailing."

engage in sustainable development and to integrate environmental and social dimensions into their traditional performance metrics. Prior research suggests that lean management and supply management are potentially important determinants of environmental performance and can be seen as capabilities that ease the adoption of environmental practices. To help understand the roles of lean and supply management in regards to improving the firm’s environmental performance, a conceptual model proposes that the magnitude of environmental practices mediates the relationship between lean and supply management with environmental performance. To test the model, plant-level survey data from a sample of Canadian manufacturing plants is used. The results indicate that supply management and lean activities provide means by which resources are invested in environmental practices. The empirical analysis also confirms that the impact of lean management, and to a lesser extent supply management, on environmental performance is mediated by environmental practices."

Blockchain is being applied in various fields home and abroad and its application cases can be explained in the banking industry, public sector, e-Commerce, medical industry, distribution and supply chain management, copyright protection. As examined in the blockchain application cases, it is expected to establish blockchain that can secure safety through distributed ledger in trade transaction because blockchain is established and applied in various sectors of industries home and abroad. Parties concerned of trade transaction can secure visibility even in interrupted specific section when they provide it as a base for distributed ledger application in trade and establish trade transaction model by applying blockchain. In case of interrupted specific section by using distributed ledger, blockchain model of trade transaction needs to be formed to make it possible for parties concerned involved in trade transaction to secure visibility and real-time tracking. Additionally, management should be possible from the time of contract until payment, freight transfer to buyers through land, air and maritime transportation.Conclusions - In order to boost blockchain-based logistics/distribution industry, the government, institutionally, needs to back up adding legal plan of shipping, logistics and distribution, reviewing standardization of electronic switching system and coming up with blockchain-based industrial road maps. In addition, the government, technologically, has to support R&D for integration with other high technology, standardization of distribution industry's blockchain technology and manpower training to expand technology development."

The ANSI C design of a JPEG encoder is further transferred into a web-based codesign framework, which utilize web servers, CGI programs (in C or PERL), GCC compiler, SPIM simulator, and Cadence EDA tools. In about seventy working minutes, the respective design of a MIPS-like processor (hardware) in TSMC 0.18um VLSI layout with machine code (software) is going to be automatically accomplished in the web-based codesign framework. The full detailed HW/SW design is capable to be automatically e-mailed return to remote user for further application. In the web-based codesign framework, the MIPS-like processor is designed by using alogrithmic state machine and Verilog hardware description language.

Businesses, consumers, government regulators, and academic researchers face a variety of questions when analyzing these nascent markets. Will electronic markets have less friction than comparable conventional markets? What factors lead to dispersion in Internet prices? What are the major electronic commerce developments to watch in the coming years? This paper addresses these questions by reviewing current academic research, discussing the implications of this research, and proposing areas for future study. We review evidence that Internet markets are more efficient than conventional markets with respect to price levels, menu costs, and price elasticity. However, several studies find substantial and persistent dispersion in prices on the Internet. This price dispersion may be explained, in part, by heterogeneity in retailer-specific factors such as trust and awareness. In addition, we note that Internet markets are still in an early stage of development and may change dramatically in the coming years with the development of cross-channel sales strategies, infomediaries and shopbots, improved supply chain management, and new information markets."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review a sample of the literature relating to the integration and implementation of supply chain management practices from a strategic viewpoint. Design/methodology/approach – The literature is examined from three perspectives. First, supply chain integration covers issues relating to integration of core processes across organizational boundaries through improved communication, partnerships, alliances and cooperation. Second, strategy and planning examines supply chain management as a strategic matter for trading partners, along with factors relating to the amount of planning required. Third, implementation issues concern factors critical for successful implementation, as well as issues specific to inter and intra-organizational aspects of supply chain initiatives are contained in this sub-group Findings – An important emergent theme from the literature is the importance of taking a holistic view, and the systemic nature of interactions between the participants. At the same time, it is also apparent that this requirement to take such an holistic and systemic view of the supply chain acts as an impediment to more extensive implementation. The strategic nature of adopting a supply chain wide perspective, on the one hand provides significant potential benefit, and on the other requires trading partners to think and act strategically. This is easier said than done within a stand-alone organization, let alone across a diverse and dispersed group of trading partners. Research limitations/implications – The scope of this review is by design limited to a cross-section of the literature in this area. As such, it cannot, and does not, attempt to be an examination of the full range of the literature, but a sampling of important and influential works. Practical implications – This review of the literature serves to highlight the inter-dependence between integration (technologies, logistics, and partnerships), a strategic view of supply chain systems, and implementation approach. All three need to inform and underpin each other in order for management of supply chains to be able to deliver on the promise of benefits for all trading partners. Originality/value – This study reviews a sample of recent and classic literature in this field, and in doing so provides some clear guidelines for the conduct of future research."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the complex interrelationships among environmental drivers, Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) approaches and performance. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was sent to a sample of managers in the field of Purchasing and Supply Management in Spanish firms. Data were analysed using SmartPLS 2.0 to test a model that relates GSCM drivers, GSCM approaches and performance. Findings – Results show that coercive and non-coercive drivers have different implications in terms of GSCM approaches. Moreover, monitoring itself is not sufficient to improve performance; firms need to adopt collaborative practices with their suppliers. Results show that whereas collaboration has a direct effect on performance, monitoring has only an indirect relationship through collaboration. Research limitations/implications – One of the main limitations of this study is the use of data from a single country (Spain). The main contribution of the paper is to show that coercive and non-coercive drivers have different effects on the GSCM approaches. Additionally, it quantifies the mediating effect of collaboration on the relationship between monitoring and environmental performance. As further research, the authors suggest the replication of this study in other countries (notably in emerging markets) and industrial sectors. Practical implications – This study provides guidance to managers in the implementation of specific approaches of GSCM. For example, it shows that monitoring alone has no direct effect on performance whereas joint collaborative initiatives with suppliers have a significant effect on environmental performance. Originality/value – This study analyses the implications in terms of drivers and performance for each GSCM approach (monitoring and collaboration), using a quantitative approach."

This makes it necessary for scientific journals to increasingly use technological elements and resources to gain greater visibility and disseminate the knowledge authors shared for their readers. To such an end, authors need to be absolutely clear about the importance of metadata, correct citation, or rigorous referencing in standardized formats, because in some way, in addition to good content and consistent structure, depending on the type of paper, these bring on broader readership, downloads, and citations for their papers. In addition to addressing these technical elements, journals must have their editorial processes under constant transformation as determined by self-evaluation processes coupled with strategies that seek improvement. Another vital element is to define the journal’s scope and approach because these elements help both authors and readers to decide whether it is the right journal to publish or consult. In Cuadernos de Administración, the editorial and production evaluation process is understood as a peer dialogue in an academic context, and opinions, recommendations, and editorial decisions are framed in respect among the process participants from each one’s role. It is the academic community that develops around a scientific journal that determines its future and relevance.Issue 67 of the journal Cuadernos de Administración, May-August 2020, after a double-blind evaluation and the editorial process, set out to publish ten papers on scientific and technological research and one review paper.The first group contains scientific and technological research papers. The group’s first one is entitled “Organizational characterization of craftsmanship in northern of Valle del Cauca.” Therein, the authors present the organizational state of artisans in developing their profession or trade in the municipalities that make up the northern region of Valle del Cauca (Colombia). Using a documentary analysis and in consultation with stakeholders, they identified the territory’s comparative and competitive advantages from the productive vocation and its relationship to artisanal production. The results seek to propose innovative strategies to strengthen the region’s craftsmanship.The second article, presents the results of a research that sought to establish the effectiveness of the constructivist training method in the business administration program, based on the Balanced Scorecard and others management tools, and from the students’, the entrepreneurs’, the institutions’ and the teaching perspectives. The study employed the quantitative and qualitative analysis coupled with surveys applied to a group of students and entrepreneurs. The authors hope these results will contribute to improving teaching in these programs.The third paper, “Sustainable design of reverse supply chain for solid waste in Mexico,” proposes an Inverse Supply Chain procedure for Urban Solid Waste in the Mexican municipality of Netzahualcóyotl.The fourth paper presents the results of surveillance, and strategic intelligence applied on the scientific, technological, and commercial trends of 10 natural ingredients prioritized in the project “Strengthening R&D capabilities for the production of natural ingredients (NI) from residual biomass in Palmira, Vall del Cauca.” The findings analyze pineapple, soursop, and peach palm fruit. The fifth manuscript, “Identification of organizational leaders’ managerial competences in the passiflowers producing sector in the department of Huila,” results from a research that sought to identify managerial competencies in the sector. The authors used mixed methods to enable managers of passiflower producing associations in the production chain to obtain a map of managerial competencies to strengthen their managerial capabilities and competitiveness. In the sixth article, the authors aim to establish the factors that influence mobile banking’s embracing by microentrepreneurs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (PB) and the TPB extended to relative advantage and perceived risk. To that end, they used quantitative methods on a sample of 101 microentrepreneurs. The findings confirm the effect of attitude, subjective norms, behavior control, and relative advantage over mobile banking adoption.The seventh paper, “Effects of the prices of mining and energy commodities on the Colombian economy,” evaluates the impact from price changes shocks in mining and energy goods that bear the highest weight on Colombian exports, i.e., oil, coal, and nickel. In this vein, they observe the different effects on economic aggregates. A database consisting of 129 variables for the 2001-2016 period was used, and a FAVAR model was estimated.The eighth article, analyzes the impact of organizational strategies on the financial performance of large-, medium- and small-sized rubber and plastic companies in the Metropolitan Area of Bucaramanga, Colombia. The authors used qualitative and quantitative methods. They analyze indicators and then characterize the strategic orientation and performance in 2017 through a survey.The ninth paper, “Adjustment by the effect of size on the cost of equity: Pending practice in the capital budget in Colombia,” identifies and analyzes the implications of capital budget techniques implemented by large-, medium- and small-size companies in connection to the use and calculation of the discount rate. For this purpose, they use descriptive analysis to characterize a group of 182 Colombian companies.The tenth article, entitled “Training for professional judgment in accounting education,” aims to analyze, in the educational projects of high-quality Public Accounting programs in Colombia, the approach to professional judgment and critical thinking as a factor contributing to the formation of this judgment in accountants. They use a qualitative-documentary methodology on the Syllabus of accredited universities’ programs.The last paper, “Gender job gaps and challenges in the digital economy: Findings from global governance entities,” makes a descriptive review of the most recent studies on gender labor gaps as prepared by the leading entities of global governance, focusing on technological and scientific areas. Moreover, the author shows the risk of erosion, and even loss, of women’s progress in recognition, inclusion, and equality. The author also argues that despite the achievements in closing educational, health, and economic gaps, the wage gap and the access-to-management gap continue to exist. We hope that the eleven papers in this issue will contribute knowledge to the sciences of administration. The content of each paper is its authors’ responsibility and not the journal’s. We hope that they will contribute to future reflections and research. We thank the authors, reviewers, committee members, and readers of our journal for being part of this academic community."

Materials that adhere to this description are designated as Sensorial Materials. Their development is multidisciplinary and requires knowledge beyond materials science in fields like sensor science, computer science, energy harvesting, microsystems technology, low-power electronics, energy management, and communication. Development of such materials will benefit from systematic support for bridging research area boundaries. The present article introduces the backbone of an easy-to-use toolbox for layout of the energy supply of smart sensor nodes within a sensorial material. The fundamental approach is transferred from rapid control development, where a comparable MATLAB/Simulink tool chain is already in use. The main goal is to manage limited power resources without unacceptably compromising functionality in a given application scenario. The toolbox allows analysis of the modeled system in terms of energy and power and allows analyzing factors such as energy harvesting, use of predictive power estimation, power saving (e.g. sleep modes), model-based cognitive data reduction methods, and energy aware algorithm switching. It is linked to a simulation environment allowing analysis of energy demand and production in a specific application scenario. Its initial version presented here supports single self-powered sensor nodes. A broad set of application cases is used to develop scenario-dependent solutions with minimum energy needs and thus demonstrate the use of the toolbox and the associated development process. The initial test case is a large-scale sensor network with optical fiber-based data and energy transmission, for which optimization of energy consumption is attempted. The toolbox can be used to improve the power-aware design of sensor nodes on digital hardware level using advanced high-level synthesis approaches and provides input for sensor node and sensor network level. © The Author(s) 2013."

The DCO with hybrid architecture consists of two parts: DCO high and DCO low. The DCO high decides the coarse output frequency of DCO, and adopts the cascade structure to decrease the area. The DCO low adopts the chain structure with three-state buffer, and decides the fine output frequency of DCO. Compared with traditional cascade DCO, the proposed hybrid DCO features higher precision with less inherent delay. Therefore the clock generator can tolerate process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variation and meet the needs of different conditions. The DCO is designed in SMIC 180 nm CMOS process with 0.021 mm2 chip area. The output frequency is adjusted from 15-120 MHz. The frequency error is less than 0.83% at 25 MHz with 1.6-1.8 V supply voltage and 0-80 °C temperature variations in TT, FF, SS corners."

Abstract Fashion markets are synonymous with rapid change and, as a result, commercial success or failure is largely determined by the organisation's flexibility and responsiveness. Responsiveness is characterised by short time-to-market, the ability to scale up (or down) quickly and the rapid incorporation of consumer preferences into the design process. In this paper it is argued that conventional organisational structures and forecast-driven supply chains are not adequate to meet the challenges of volatile and turbulent demand which typify fashion markets. Instead, the requirement is for the creation of an agile organisation embedded within an agile supply chain."

Abstract Purpose – Increasingly, private sector companies are aiming to buy and supply products and services in a sustainable way, termed "" sustainable supply chain management "" (sustainable SCM), using purchasing and supply to reduce negative impacts on the environment, economy and society. There is often a gap between rhetoric and reality, with companies often accused of paying green lip service to sustainable SCM. This research aims to explore sustainable SCM issues in companies that have been recognized as leaders in their sectors, and investigate what factors influence sustainable SCM, and how practice might change in the future. Design/methodology/approach – Current practice in sustainable SCM and predictions for the future were explored in case studies of seven UK companies, through semi-structured interviews with purchasers and CSR practitioners, and secondary data collection from reports and websites. Sectors included aerospace, retail, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink. Findings – Companies were mapped onto a typology of approaches to sustainable SCM, based on internal and external enablers and barriers. Companies were classified as Internal focusers, Reserved players, External responders, and Agenda setters. Predictions for the future of sustainable SCM within the companies were also explored. Research limitations/implications – The typology could be further explored through a survey of firms from different sectors, and with firms not seen as leading in their field. Originality/value – The paper draws on contingency theory and existing sustainable SCM literature to develop a typology of approaches to sustainable SCM. The paper draws useful lessons from leading companies for practitioners seeking to implement sustainable SCM."

Industry 4.0 is relatively novel to developing nations, especially in India and needs a clear definition for proper understanding and practice in business. This paper aims to recognize key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives and analyze the identified key challenges to prioritize them for effective Industry 4.0 concepts for supply chain sustainability in emerging economies by taking Indian manufacturing industry perspective. Industry 4.0 initiatives can help industries to incorporate environmental protection and control initiatives as well as process safety measures in supply chains towards sustainable supply chains. However, adoption of Industry 4.0 initiatives is not so easy due to existence of many challenges. Therefore, the present research identifies 18 key challenges to Industry 4.0 initiatives for developing supply chain sustainability using an extensive literature review. These challenges were analyzed through 96 responses received from Indian manufacturing sector using a questionnaire based survey. Explanatory Factor Analysis results classified identified challenges into four key dimensions of challenges. Analytical Hierarchy Process further ranks the identified dimensions of challenges and related challenges. Findings of the study revealed that Organizational challenges holds the highest importance followed by Technological challenges, Strategic challenges, and Legal and ethical issues. This work is very useful for practitioners, policy makers, regulatory bodies and managers to develop an in-depth understanding of Industry 4.0 initiatives and eradicate the potential challenges in adopting Industry 4.0 initiatives for supply chain sustainability. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers"

The company’s market value has more than halved to an 11-year low as it acknowledged overstating profits by hundreds of millions of dollars. And a humbled Warren Buffett, after opportunistically raising his stake in the company after a surprise profit warning, confessed to CNBC: “I made a mistake on Tesco. That was a huge mistake by me.” Indeed. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain has not only seen its fortunes erode but its reputation for competitiveness, creativity and integrity collapse. Even before its accounting travails, a former chairman had sharply criticized former CEO Sir Terry Leahy, who had led Tesco to market dominance and worldwide admiration, for leaving a shambles of a legacy. Leahy’s immediate successor resigned in July; his successor from Unilever now confronts more of a turnaround than he had ever expected. What the heck happened to Tesco? Many analysts and unhappy investors point to Tesco’s ill-fated Fresh & Easy convenience store foray in America just as the global financial crisis kicked in. The failed expansion effort ultimately led to write-downs topping $3 billion. At the same time, dramatically increased price competition by discounters such as Aldi severely undercut Tesco’s “every little helps” value proposition. The company still declines to say whether its systemic supplier-related accounting misstatements better reflect malpractice or malfeasance. Regardless, Tesco’s collective failures feel operational, organizational and cultural. This isn’t simply bad luck. But beyond the business cliches of “big bets gone bad” and “not keeping one’s eye on the ball” is the disconcerting fact that the core competencies that made Tesco a marketing juggernaut and analytics icon appear almost irrelevant to its unhappy narrative of erosion and decay. More than any other retailer of scale, Tesco had committed to customer research, analytics, and loyalty as its marketing and operational edge. For example, the supermarket ingeniously succeeded at Internet-enabled grocery shopping in ways that Webvan—remember them?—could not. Tesco was digital before digital was cool. Tesco’s Clubcard loyalty program was launched under Leahy in 1995 and redefined both the company and the industry. As the Telegraph recently observed, “Tesco was transformed into the market leader in the UK—with more than 30pc market share—by being able to respond to the demands of its customers.” American supermarkets—notably Kroger—admired and sought to emulate Tesco’s success. Even Walmart—overwhelmingly focused on optimizing its everyday low-pricing supply chain logistics—took Tesco’s command of customer analytics seriously. Practically every retail Big Data and analytics case study over the past decade explicitly referenced Tesco as “best practice.” With the notable exception of, say, an Amazon, no global store chain was thought to have demonstrably keener data-driven insight into customer loyalty and behavior. But the harsh numbers suggest that all this data, all this analytics, all the assiduous segmentation, customization and promotion have done little for Tesco’s domestic competitiveness since Leahy’s celebrated departure. As the Telegraph story further observed, “…judging by correspondence from Telegraph readers and disillusioned shoppers, one of the reasons that consumers are turning to [discounters] Aldi and Lidl is that they feel they are simple and free of gimmicks. Shoppers are questioning whether loyalty cards, such as Clubcard, are more helpful to the supermarket than they are to the shopper.” How damning; how daunting; how disturbing for any and every serious data-driven enterprise and marketer. If true, Tesco’s decline present a clear and unambiguous warning that even rich and data-rich loyalty programs and analytics capabilities can’t stave off the competitive advantage of slightly lower prices and a simpler shopping experience. Better insights, loyalty and promotion may not be worthless, but they are demonstrably worth less in this retail environment. A harsher alternative interpretation is that, despite its depth of data and experience, today’s Tesco simply lacks the innovation and insight chops to craft promotions, campaigns and offers that allow it to even preserve share, let alone grow it. What a damming indictment of Tesco’s people, processes and customer programs that would be. In less than a decade, the driver and determinant of Tesco’s success has devolved into an analytic albatross. Knowledge goes from power to impotence. There’s nothing new or unusual in a one-time business strength turning into an organizational weakness or an industrial irrelevance. But when we’re talking about customer data, insight, loyalty and all the ingredients that—supposedly—go into giving digital enterprises their information edge, then it’s time to get nervous and ask hard questions. Is Tesco’s fall from grace a typical tale of shambolic succession and enterprise lassitude as times turned tougher? Or is it a market signal that Big Data, predictive analytics, and customer insight aren’t the sustainable competitive weaponry they’re cracked up to be? The schadenfreude gang may be counting on the former; but datanauts who referenced Tesco to sell their bosses on analytic investments would be wise to consider the latter possibility. Or is it probability?

Linking the new idea of RFID in P&G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention. It summed up an important insight-one that 10 years later, after the Internet of Things has become the title of everything from an article in Scientific American to the name of a European Union conference, is still often misunderstood. The fact that I was probably the first person to say ""Internet of Things"" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. But what I meant, and still mean, is this: Today computers-and, therefore, the Internet-are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings-by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. Conventional diagrams of the Internet include servers and routers and so on, but they leave out the most numerous and important routers of all: people. The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy-all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. And that's a big deal. We're physical, and so is our environment. Our economy, society and survival aren't based on ideas or information-they're based on things. You can't eat bits, burn them to stay warm or put them in your gas tank. Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. Yet today's information technology is so dependent on data originated by people that our computers know more about ideas than things. If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things-using data they gathered without any help from us-we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling, and whether they were fresh or past their best. We need to empower computers with their own means of gathering information, so they can see, hear and smell the world for themselves, in all its random glory. RFID and sensor technology enable computers to observe, identify and understand the world-without the limitations of human-entered data. Ten years on, we've made a lot of progress, but we in the RFID community need to understand what's so important about what our technology does, and keep advocating for it. It's not just a ""bar code on steroids"" or a way to speed up toll roads, and we must never allow our vision to shrink to that scale. The Internet of Things has the potential to change the world, just as the Internet did. Maybe even more so."

The objective of this study is two-fold: first to identify the constituents that mold the fast fashion retailing business model, and second to discuss how global leader of fast fashion retailing Inditex-Zara’s product offering is strongly supported by integration of various supply chain operations. The findings suggest that vertical integration through ownership of various operational stages including product design and development, production operation, logistics and distribution channel; appropriate sourcing strategy to meet product needs; application of process/product modularity practices in product design, material procurement and manufacturing to ensure manufacturing flexibility; flexible logistics capability; and all of these seamlessly integrated and coordinated by a centralized IT infrastructure can significantly raise overall supply chain flexibility and responsiveness. Inditex-Zara’s super-responsive supply chain reduces ‘bullwhip effect’, order-to-delivery lead time to stores, ensures lean inventory and high level of responsiveness to adapt and deliver products to stores with latest fashion trends and customer feedbacks at a rapid speed. Thus Inditex-Zara is able to successfully counter the negative effects of short product life cycles, high product variety, demand uncertainty and thus able to closely match product supply to the stores with market demand. This contributes to lower inventory backlogs; avoid mark-down losses and/or inventory stock out."

The research objective is to explore their real-world combination and propose strategies for the alignment of SCM and BIM, by viewing Supply Chain (SC) partnering as the inter-organisational proxy of SCM. The main question is: How to align the SCM philosophy with BIM technologies to achieve integration in the construction industry? What aspects contribute to this alignment?. The methodology was mixed and both qualitative and quantitative data were analysed. The overarching method was case study research and the unit of analysis was the firm, also referred to as actor. After a semi-chronological review of the relevant literature, the two constructs of SCM and BIM were found interdependent in product-, process-, and actor-related (P/P/A) dimensions. The study consisted of four other consecutive studies. First, empirical insights into the practical implementation of SC partnering and BIM were obtained via the exploration of five cases. Second, a conceptual model for the quantitative analysis of the product-, process-, and actor-related dimensions was designed. Third, this model and mixed methods were applied to two polar (extreme) cases to analyse the contractual (typically SC-related), digital (typically BIM-related), and informal interactions among the involved actors. Fourth, an additional theoretical exploration of the BIM-enabled SC partnerships took place with focusing also on intra-organisational relations within the involved firms. After the four studies, the findings were systematically combined to create the theoretical synthesis, i.e. generate theory. Three consecutive steps of construct, internal, and external validity took place after the synthesis, to define the transferability of findings. The systematic combination of findings deduced two routes to achieve SC integration in construction: (a) product-related (emphasis on BIM tools), and (b) actor-related (emphasis on SCM philosophy). The two observed routes to SC integration emerged from the data of the polar cases. Two complementary sets of strategies for SC integration were derived afterwards. These strategies could ease the identification of which route is the closest fit to SC integration, and then support the decision-making of how to pursue it. As the concept of BIM is currently a hot topic, it might be wise to undertake a product-related route to integration and gradually introduce strategies from the actor-related route. However, the actor-related route could attain long-term integration and thus, long-lasting relations among the multi-actor networks. The key aspects of the alignment of partnering with construction IT for BIM-enabled SC partnerships are: - The identification of whether the SC complexity is of process-, product- or actor-related nature; - The deployed BIM collaboration patterns, i.e. ad-hoc, linear or distributed; - The SC coordination mechanisms, e.g. centralised or decentralised; - The relation between formal and informal aspects, e.g. symmetric or asymmetric; - The emerging intra-organisational relations due to BIM and SCM implementation; - The hierarchical level that BIM-enabled SC partnership decision-making pertains. As the construction industry evolves into an information-driven sector, the alignment of construction IT with inter-organisational management is preeminent for managing the inherent complexities of the industry. In parallel, embracing inter-organisational approaches for information management such as BIM is a promisingway forward for SCM and construction management. ©2016 Eleni Papadonikolaki."

Companies such as GE, Lockheed Martin, and BMW are switching to it for industrial production at scale. More companies will follow as the range of printable materials continues to expand. Already available are basic plastics, photosensitive resins, ceramics, cement, glass, numerous metals, thermoplastic composites (some infused with carbon nanotubes and fibers), and even stem cells. In this article the author makes the case that additive manufacturing will gain ground quickly, given advantages such as greater flexibility, fewer assembly steps and other cost savings, and enhanced product-design possibilities. Managers, D’Aveni writes, should now be engaging with strategic questions on three levels: Sellers of tangible products should ask how their offerings could be improved, whether by themselves or by competitors. Industrial enterprises should revisit their operations to determine what network of supply chain assets and what mix of old and new processes will be optimal. And leaders must consider the strategic implications as whole commercial ecosystems begin to form around the new realities of 3-D printing. Many of the biggest players already in the business of additive manufacturing are vying to develop the platforms on which other companies will build and connect. Platform owners will be powerful because production itself is likely to become commoditized over time. Those facilitating connections in the digital ecosystem will sit in the middle of a tremendous volume of industrial transactions, collecting and selling valuable information.

We start with a benchmark case where mergers do not generate any synergy. By assuming that firms compete in Bertrand or Cournot fashion, we compare the effects of an upstream merger with a downstream one. We find that upstream (respectively, downstream) mergers always benefit the merging firms, while adversely affecting their dependent downstream (respectively, upstream) supply chain partners; non-dependent suppliers and non-dependent retailers also benefit from such horizontal mergers. Moreover, an upstream merger is more detrimental to consumers than a downstream merger. We then analyze three extended models: (i) In a case where mergers generate synergies through economies of scale at both levels, merging firms still benefit while non-merging competitors suffer a loss in profit.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the preferred minimum level of segregation for halal meat in supermarket, transport, storage and terminals; the responsibility of halal logistics; and the willingness to pay for halal logistics in a Muslim and non-Muslim country. Design/methodology/approach – This is a comparative study involving Muslim consumers in Malaysia and The Netherlands. Cross-sectional data were collected through a survey with 251 Muslims in Malaysia and 250 Muslims in The Netherlands. Data were analysed by means of nonparametric tests. Findings – There is a preferred higher level of segregation in a Muslim country than a non-Muslim country. A Muslim country has a higher willingness to pay for a halal logistics system as compared to a non-Muslim country. Furthermore, there lies a heavy responsibility with the manufacturer to extend halal assurance towards supply chain management. Research limitations/implications – The study confirms there is a need for a different level of segregation and therefore different halal logistics standard in a Muslim country and a non-Muslim country. However, during the survey in The Netherlands significant rejections were received from especially first generation Muslims due to the lack of understanding of the Dutch language. Similar surveys need to be conducted in other countries in order to be able to generalise over the various Islamic schools of thought, local fatwas and local customs. Practical implications – Halal logistics is important to the Muslim consumer and critical for the trust in a halal certified brand, which requires extending halal integrity from point of production to the point of consumer purchase. Originality/value – This study is a preliminary one investigating the consumer perception on halal logistics. The study indicates the level of segregation required for a halal meat supply chain in a Muslim and non-Muslim country."

Material and MethodsA literature review using PubMed, Cochrane Review, and Google Scholar database search was performed using the keyword terms “COVID-19”, “Coronavirus”, “Personal Protective Equipment” (PPE), “healthcare workers” (HCW), “protection”, “masks”, and “urology”. Non-English articles were excluded. We present a summary of key guidance provided by regulatory bodies as well as some of the key articles published to date relating to PPE. DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 virus is found mainly in the respiratory system but is also in blood, feces, semen, and urine. Both standard infection control precautions (SICPs) and transmission-based precautions (TBPs) are nec-essary to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 infection. PPE includes gowns, gloves, masks or respirators, goggles, and face shields; however, wearing PPE is only part of many precautionary measures that are necessary to prevent viral transmission. When used appropriately PPE not only protects HCWs from patients but also protects patients from HCWs who may be asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 infection. Attention should also be paid to fit testing and fit checking, donning and doffing, and ever-evolving guide-lines on PPE. Wearing PPE for a long time is also technically challenging and may adversely affect surgical outcomes. Shortages of PPE in the supply chain during the peak of the pandemic as well as concerns about substandard PPE should be considered for a possible second wave of COVID-19. Other key measures to minimize nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission are a symptom and temperature screening of patients and staff; controlling the flow of patients, staff, and relatives in hospitals; self-isolation by patients before elective surgery; a robust testing protocol for both patients and staff; patient and staff cohorting; physical distancing; good hand hygiene; respiratory etiquette including face coverings for patients, staff and visitors; proper disposal of waste and enhanced cleaning; thorough cleaning and sterilization of surgical equipment performed post-operatively; choosing suitable anesthetic methods to minimize aerosolization of the virus; and if possible ensuring a negative-pressure theatre environment while dealing with COVID-19 positive patients. As scientific and regulatory bodies continue to issue updated guidance as more data is collected and a better knowledge base is developed regarding COVID-19 employers and staff need to keep up to date with guidance also. ConclusionCOVID-19 will be around for the foreseeable future and infection rates may fluctuate as restrictions are eased. HCWs including urologists should take appropriate PPE measures not only in theatres, clinics, and endoscopy suits but also when performing simple tasks such as urine dipsticks, catheter, nephrostomy management, digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate biopsies, etc. as SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in feces, urine, and semen. Both employers and HCWs should adhere strictly to current guidelines and work together to minimize nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 infection."

Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. And, once entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer­to­peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non­financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology and revolution in this space has just begun. This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and non­financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world."

They also have to produce clothing cost-effectively for a market which is supplied largely from countries with very low wage rates. Given that clothing production is labour intensive, many developments have been geared towards labour-saving automation so that producers in developed countries are more able to compete with low cost countries. Automation is more appropriate for producers in developed countries than in developing countries where most of the clothing industry is now based. However, it is appropriate in some developing countries where there are growing shortages of skilled labour. In addition, developments are helping companies to achieve higher and consistent quality levels in order to meet the increasingly stringent demands being placed on them by buyers. A growing number of developments is being aimed at the requirements of the industries in specific countries, notably China. Technological developments are also helping companies to differentiate their product offerings and to operate more efficient supply chains. In doing so, these developments are enabling producers to meet pressures from retailers for quicker delivery times and more efficient management of stock levels. This report examines developments in four areas of apparel technology: developments in apparel manufacturing technology; developments in garment decoration; three-dimensional clothing design and visualisation technology; and radio frequency identification (RFID). Developments in garment decoration include machines for embroidery, lasers for cutting applications, direct-to-garment digital printing, methods of attaching sequins, and embossing. RFID enables manufacturers and retailers to track the location and progress of a product anywhere in the supply chain. Also an RFID-tagged piece of clothing can be held in front of a ""magicmirror"" in a retail store to display various types of personalised information. © Textiles Intelligence Limited 2007."

Now construction companies are under pressure to find ways of enhancing effectiveness and quality, of increasing speed of project delivery whilst simultaneously reducing costs and prices. The construction industry can learn from the successes of manufacturing and service industries. To illustrate the point, this paper draws on examples of success stories, which have applied the enterprise resource planning (ERP) supply chain management (SCM) solutions.

Some of the economics of the dispersed vision are explored, and perspectives are presented on both the choice of homogeneous universal power quality upstream in the electricity supply chain and on the extremely heterogeneous requirements of end-use loads. It is argued that meeting the demanding requirements of sensitive loads by local provision of high quality power may be more cost effective than increasing the quality of universal homogeneous supply upstream in the legacy grid. Finally, the potential role of microgrids in delivering heterogeneous power quality is demonstrated by reference to two ongoing microgrid tests in the U.S. and Japan."

Specifically, we identify six IFW differentiators: explosive storage, very large number of beehive storage locations, bins with commingled SKUs, immediate fulfilment, short picking routes with single unit picks and high transactions with total digital control. Explosive storage of incoming bulk allows for faster fulfilment of customer orders often within a few hours. A new IFW control model is developed. This describes the associated receiving and fulfilment flows. Two decision algorithms for generating (i) a stocking list and (ii) an order picking list are presented. A simulation model was built to evaluate the fulfilment performance of the explosive policy. Experimental runs on a problem with 400 SKUs, 3240 bins and 22,000 customer orders over nine days are reported. Results show that increasing levels of explosion reduce the linear fulfilment time by as much as 16%, confirming the IFW storage policy is advantageous. The results also show that fulfilment time behaviour is convex as a function of the maximum number of stops allowed by the picking algorithm parameter."

In fact, 15 years from now, it could be worth $4.5 trillion. The circular economy creates value as it elimi-nates waste while upending traditional notions of competitiveness. What would have been missed eco-nomic and business opportunity (e.g. lost resources and underused assets) becomes valuable in the cir-cular economy. What does that mean for the supply chain? Consider Optoro, a company that creates sustainable commerce by helping businesses gain value from returned products and excess goods. Optoro works with companies to mine the value out of their reverse supply chain. Rather than viewing product returns as a waste or liability, circular-focused software helps companies find renewed value. In fact, retailers often discard nearly one-third of products returned to their store. That's costly. Some estimate that the associated handling and lost rev-enue are in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And even more than the cost, it also comes down to waste and carbon. The Optoro story illustrates one way supply chains can work in two directions. For decades, supply chains and products flowed in one direction: from produc-tion to consumption, and ultimately to the dump. In a world with increasingly constrained resources and environmental challenges, supply chains need to work in two directions to cut waste and contribute to sustainable, profitable growth. Reverse supply chains can return valuable resources to a company by creating full-cycle pro-duction loops. Consider fashion designer Eileen Fisher. Tags in the garments tell customers: "" We'd like our clothes back. Recycle them at our U.S. stores and support Green Eileen. "" Top executives from IKEA recently announced that their company would use 100% renewable or recycled plastics in their home furnishings by 2020. As a result, the company estimates that it will prevent 700,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually while creat-ing greater interest in return chains. Few companies have scaled to the degree targeted by Ikea. Many struggle to access a full suite of cradle-to-cradle products at predictable prices. As supply increases, demand is likely to increase in tandem, and companies will find it easier to join the circle as the volume, pricing and quality associated with these supplies becomes increasingly reliable. IKEA's approach is not the only way forward. Consider a tire manufacturer that now offers its products as a service. It's a proposition that funda-mentally questions the value and desirability of tire ownership. After all, customers have leased cars and other vehicles for decades. There are any number of products with high price tags and long payoff times—items that consumers rarely use. Whether it's a city dweller who generally finds mass transit more efficient than driving during rush hour and paying daily parking fees, or a home-owner who periodically needs a power tool or piece"

Linking the new idea of RFID in P&G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention. It summed up an important insight—one that 10 years later, after the Internet of Things has become the title of everything from an article in Scientific American to the name of a European Union conference, is still often misunderstood. The fact that I was probably the first person to say ""Internet of Things"" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. But what I meant, and still mean, is this: Today computers—and, therefore, the Internet—are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings—by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. Conventional diagrams of the Internet include servers and routers and so on, but they leave out the most numerous and important routers of all: people. The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy—all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. And that's a big deal. We're physical, and so is our environment. Our economy, society and survival aren't based on ideas or information—they're based on things. You can't eat bits, burn them to stay warm or put them in your gas tank. Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. Yet today's information technology is so dependent on data originated by people that our computers know more about ideas than things."

The first task was to adopt the tried and tested model for delivering growth by scoping existing creative businesses in the region and finding a focus. ‘Blueprint for Growth: Strengthening the Games Sector’ was the catalyst — using the games industry as a gateway for the wider creative sector. Creative businesses saw the potential benefits to their own industries in ‘Blueprint’. Business engagement with the creative sector significantly increased and clusters took shape. To showcase the diversity of creative industries in all their glory, common threads were sought. These threads not only ran through the creative sector, they also started to form bridges to other clusters — including automotive. The idea of creativity as a way of thinking and a tool for all sectors began to surface and advances in technology became cross-cluster opportunities. The fertile ground between clusters allows for the growth of supporting professional services and provides a foundation for culture and place to thrive. This delicate ecosystem requires continual nurture best delivered by those ‘on the ground’."

Abstract Purpose – This paper aims to give an overview of supply chain collaboration practices and the way the underlying enabling technologies have evolved, from the classical EDI approach, to web-based and RFID-enabled collaboration. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses alternative technological approaches and the role they play in supporting collaboration. The research presented in this paper is empirical in nature, based on three different case studies from the grocery retail sector depicting different aspects of implementing supply chain collaboration practices. Findings – From the examination of these cases, interesting lessons are derived regarding the suitability and criticality of the technological approach used to support collaboration, especially regarding the use of a centralized web-platform as compared to the classical EDI approach and to a decentralized solution based on web services. Research limitations/implications – Research is limited to the specific case studies and further validation of the research findings through qualitative and quantitative methods would be appropriate. Practical implications – The paper provides support to practitioner regarding the selection of the appropriate technological approach to support collaboration. Furthermore, it gives insight regarding the maturity of current technologies in relation to collaboration requirements and to what extent can the technology be an enabler or a barrier in a collaboration initiative. Originality/value – The paper links the technological and the supply-chain collaboration perspective in order to derive interesting conclusions relevant to both academics and practitioners. The cases presented are quite unique and have not been widely studied, representing interesting and novel approaches to the way that technology has been employed to support collaboration practices."

No matter that the United States still leads in developing the most innovative technologies. U.S. and European companies have been paying an increasing fraction of their revenues to Japanese components and hardware suppliers, the same companies that are their primary future competitors. Why? Because digital technology is ushering in an era of inexpensive personal systems built from standard, mass-produced components. We are witnessing the digitization of everything. Previously unrelated industries--cameras, stereos, typewriters--are converging to form a huge information technology sector. In view of this commoditization of product markets, companies able to manufacture (or corner the market it) components are gaining ground. These facts play directly to the strengths of Japanese companies such as Canon, Matsushita, and NEC. Embedded in industrial combines known as keiretsu, they make continuing investments in technology and manufacturing, command the supply chain from components to end products, and coordinate their strategic approaches to block foreign competition and penetrate world markets. The U.S. industry has failed to develop the structures and strategies necessary for commercial success in the markets created by U.S. innovations. But several U.S. and European companies show signs of vision in the embryonic alliances they've created. Now is the time to build on these alliances and form American versions of the keiretsu.

This is because with supply chain attacks, the attackers are relying on the trust relationship between a manufacturer or supplier and a customer. This trust relationship is then abused to attack organizations and individuals and may be performed for a number of different reasons. The Nyetya worm that was released into the wild earlier in 2017 showed just how potent these types of attacks can be. Frequently, as with Nyetya, the initial infection vector can remain elusive for quite some time. Luckily with tools like AMP the additional visibility can usually help direct attention to the initial vector. Talos recently observed a case where the download servers used by software vendor to distribute a legitimate software package were leveraged to deliver malware to unsuspecting victims. For a period of time, the legitimate signed version of CCleaner 5.33 being distributed by Avast also contained a multi-stage malware payload that rode on top of the installation of CCleaner. CCleaner boasted over 2 billion total downloads by November of 2016 with a growth rate of 5 million additional users per week. Given the potential damage that could be caused by a network of infected computers even a tiny fraction of this size we decided to move quickly. On September 13, 2017 Cisco Talos immediately notified Avast of our findings so that they could initiate appropriate response activities. The following sections will discuss the specific details regarding this attack. TECHNICAL DETAILS CCleaner is an application that allows users to perform routine maintenance on their systems. It includes functionality such as cleaning of temporary files, analyzing the system to determine ways in which performance can be optimized and provides a more streamlined way to manage installed applications. Figure 1: Screenshot of CCleaner 5.33 On September 13, 2017 while conducting customer beta testing of our new exploit detection technology, Cisco Talos identified a specific executable which was triggering our advanced malware protection systems. Upon closer inspection, the executable in question was the installer for CCleaner v5.33, which was being delivered to endpoints by the legitimate CCleaner download servers. Talos began initial analysis to determine what was causing this technology to flag CCleaner. We identified that even though the downloaded installation executable was signed using a valid digital signature issued to Piriform, CCleaner was not the only application that came with the download. During the installation of CCleaner 5.33, the 32-bit CCleaner binary that was included also contained a malicious payload that featured a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) as well as hardcoded Command and Control (C2) functionality. We confirmed that this malicious version of CCleaner was being hosted directly on CCleaner's download server as recently as September 11, 2017. In reviewing the Version History page on the CCleaner download site, it appears that the affected version (5.33) was released on August 15, 2017. On September 12, 2017 version 5.34 was released. The version containing the malicious payload (5.33) was being distributed between these dates. This version was signed using a valid certificate that was issued to Piriform Ltd by Symantec and is valid through 10/10/2018. Piriform was the company that Avast recently acquired and was the original company who developed the CCleaner software application. Figure 2: Digital Signature of CCleaner 5.33 A second sample associated with this threat was discovered. This second sample was also signed using a valid digital certificate, however the signing timestamp was approximately 15 minutes after the initial sample was signed. The presence of a valid digital signature on the malicious CCleaner binary may be indicative of a larger issue that resulted in portions of the development or signing process being compromised. Ideally this certificate should be revoked and untrusted moving forward. When generating a new cert care must be taken to ensure attackers have no foothold within the environment with which to compromise the new certificate. Only the incident response process can provide details regarding the scope of this issue and how to best address it. Interestingly the following compilation artifact was found within the CCleaner binary that Talos analyzed: S:\workspace\ccleaner\branches\v5.33\bin\CCleaner\Release\CCleaner.pdb Given the presence of this compilation artifact as well as the fact that the binary was digitally signed using a valid certificate issued to the software developer, it is likely that an external attacker compromised a portion of their development or build environment and leveraged that access to insert malware into the CCleaner build that was released and hosted by the organization. It is also possible that an insider with access to either the development or build environments within the organization intentionally included the malicious code or could have had an account (or similar) compromised which allowed an attacker to include the code. It is also important to note that while previous versions of the CCleaner installer are currently still available on the download server, the version containing the malicious payloads has been removed and is no longer available. MALWARE INSTALLATION AND OPERATION Within the 32-bit CCleaner v5.33 binary included with the legitimate CCleaner v5.33 installer, '__scrt_get_dyn_tls_init_callback' was modified to call to the code at CC_InfectionBase(0x0040102C). This was done to redirect code execution flow within the CCleaner binary to the malicious code prior to continuing with the normal CCleaner operations. The code that is called is responsible for decrypting data which contains the two stages of the malicious payload, a PIC (Position Independent Code) PE loader as well as a DLL file that effectively functions as the malware payload. The malware author had tried to reduce the detection of the malicious DLL by ensuring the IMAGE_DOS_HEADER was zeroed out, suggesting this attacker was trying to remain under the radar to normal detection techniques. The binary then creates an executable heap using HeapCreate(HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE,0,0). Space is then allocated to this new heap which is where the contents of the decrypted data containing the malware is copied. As the data is copied to the heap, the source data is erased. The PE loader is then called and begins its operation. Once the infection process has been initiated, the binary erases the memory regions that previously contained the PE loader and the DLL file, frees the previously allocated memory, destroys the heap and continues on with normal CCleaner operations. The PE loader utilizes position independent coding practices in order to locate the DLL file within memory. It then maps the DLL into executable memory, calls the DLLEntryPoint to begin execution of the DLL being loaded and the CCleaner binary continues as normal. Once this occurs the malware begins its full execution, following the process outlined in the following sections."

heath care workers have been dealing with environmental changes which have created turbulent, complex work environments. Turbulence has been considered a negative phenomenon. However Workforce Agility may be a positive response to Environmental Turbulence. Other disciplines are familiar with the term Turbulence and Workforce Agility but there is little research available on this concept despite the impact that they may have on patient outcomes. The purpose of this research was to identify the relationship between Environmental Turbulence, Workforce Agility and Patient Outcomes through the examination of four alternative theoretical models. This research was conducted using secondary analysis of the IMPACT data set (Verran, Effken & Lamb, 2001-2004). The data were reanalyzed in order to answer different questions than the primary study. Causal modeling with path analysis and regression analysis was conducted to answer the research questions. Three questions included the use of either a moderator variable or mediator variable. The setting for the IMPACT Study was acute care hospitals in the Southwestern region of the United States. For the IMPACT study, the sample consisted of patient care units from teaching and non-teaching hospitals. Subjects consisted of staff members who were employed on the patient care units. Data collected from the Registered Nurses were used for the secondary analysis because this research was interested in looking primarily at the nursing unit. The total RN staff assigned to patient care units who responded to the questionnaires was N=454. The total number of patients who responded to the survey was N=1179. In summary, the unit characteristics that were found to be Antecedents to ET were the sub-composites of Team and Complexity. Proxy variables, Collaborative Culture Agility and Experiential Agility, were successfully formed as a composite for WFA and were tested with the primary data. No mediators or moderators were shown; however, main effects of WFA and ET did have an impact on patient outcomes."

Abstract Purpose – The paper seeks to pursue the understanding of current business-to-business e-procurement practices by describing the success factors and challenges to its implementation in the corporate setting. Design/methodology/approach – Members of the Institute for Supply Management and the Council of Logistics Management were asked to respond to a survey questionnaire. Factor analysis was used to analyze data from valid responses received from 185 firms. Findings – Factor analysis resulted in three e-procurement success factors (SF):supplier and contract management; end-user behavior and e-procurement business processes; and information and e-procurement infrastructure. Three challenge-to-implementation factors (CIF) also emerged: lack of system integration and standardization issues; immaturity of e-procurement-based market services and end-user resistance; and maverick buying and difficulty in integrating e-commerce with other systems. Research limitations/implications – A representative sampling design should be used in the future to be able to make claims for generalizable results. Practical implications – E-procurement is a very important initiative with significant cost savings potential for firms. This study's findings can guide various stages of corporate implementation efforts. Originality/value – This study fulfills the need for solid empirical findings on this very important topic that has a direct impact on a firm's bottom line. E-procurement is still in the early stages of marketplace deployment and guidance is still needed on how to do it right."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to introduce a special issue about the construction industry and the management of its supply chains. It aims to discuss and point to some differences and possible similarities with traditional manufacturing and its supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is mostly a literature review and contains official statistics. Findings – The market of the construction company is mostly local and highly volatile. The long durability of the construction "" product "" contributes to the volatility. The product specification process before the customer order arrives shows different degrees of specifications: engineer to order, modify to order, configure to order, select a variant. (The common make-to-stock in traditional manufacturing does not exist.) A construction company only executes a small part of the project by its own personnel and capacity. This is a way of risk spreading and risk mitigation and to compensate for an unstable market. If a construction company wants to establish a new concept, from "" engineer to order "" to e.g. "" configure to order "" , it must be engaged earlier in the business process and with other than usual customers, which might complicate the process. Research limitations/implications – Experiences from Sweden and Swedish developments are the main source of information. Originality/value – The paper introduces the articles that are a source of scientifically generated knowledge regarding various problems and opportunities associated with supply chain management in the project-based construction industry."

Technology is increasingly playing a crucial role in the success of organizations in the information age. The impact of Information Technology on business has been enormous. Computers and the information they process and store have permeated every aspect of the business world. The fundamental role of Information Technology is to enable businesses to find new ways to drive down the costs of products, processes, and improve performance. We use examples from five different companies/industries to show the different and dramatic effects that IT can have on a business. The television industry is using high-speed Internet to send digital dailies from location to directors and producers in Hollywood. The use of this technology eliminates the old method of dubbing tapes and then sending them via FedEx back to L.A. General Motors has used aggressive outsourcing and web-based services to increase production time. Where it used to take up to four years to get a vehicle on the market, it now takes less than two. With new management and a greater focus on quality and customer satisfaction, an aircraft company has seen its $ 15 million in debt turn into $ 243 million in revenues. These increased revenues were attained by using new software to help it get better organized. AT&T, the once Titan of the phone industry, utilized IT to get out of debt. Specifically, AT&T used web-services to allow all of its different systems to communicate. By using new software to translate three different business processes into one usable code, Cybex International used IT to fix its supply-chain mess."

The rising number of factors influencing operational decisions calls for the improvement in and further development of processes and supporting IT and PDP systems - so-called operations management systems. This applies to all process levels - from long-term planning to the scheduling of high-capacity equipment - and along the entire coal process chain, starting with mining operations and ending with the coal consumer. The operations-management systems rely on GPS-based technology which records equipment deployment and delivers a digital image of the opencast-mine progress in near real-time.

Abstract Purpose – Electronic support of internal supply chains for direct or production goods has been a major element during the implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that has taken place since the late 1980s. However, supply chains to indirect material suppliers were not usually included due to low transaction volumes, low product values and low strategic importance of these goods. Dedicated information systems for streamlining indirect goods supply chains have emerged since the late 1990s and subsequently have faced a broad diffusion in practice. The concept of these e-procurement solutions has also been described broadly in the literature. However, studies on how companies use these e-procurement solutions and what factors are critical to their implementation are only emerging. This research aims to explore the introduction of e-procurement systems and their contribution to the management of indirect goods supply chain. Design/methodology/approach – Chooses a two-part qualitative approach. First, summarizes the results of a benchmarking study that was conducted by a consortium of 12 multinational companies. During the benchmarking process 120 questionnaires were distributed, ten phone-based interviews were conducted, and finally five successful practice companies were selected and analyzed in detail. Second, draws together the success factors identified in the benchmarking study and maps them against the successful practice companies. Findings – Although e-procurement has substantially streamlined the procurement and coordination processes for indirect goods, many companies operate multiple e-procurement solutions. For integrated procurement solutions, the paper recognizes the need of an overall procurement strategy and organization, an alignment of various e-procurement solutions along the procurement process and the need for integrated system architectures. Companies also have to realize that a no standardized e-procurement solutions exists and that important success factors are "" non-technical "" in nature. Originality/value – This paper presents a first step towards a systematic analysis of factors that may guide companies in the implementation of e-procurement solutions. Besides providing a direct contribution to the project work in companies it may stimulate further research in e-procurement success factors."

An effective infrastructure requires continuous activity; creation, inspection, repair, maintenance, renewal and upgrading to satisfy society’s ever-increasing requirements for the connectivity, mobility and access to resources that underpin economic prosperity. The engineering processes associated with this activity can interrupt physical infrastructure, impacting heavily on the function of society; power cuts reduce productivity, road works cause transport delays and increased pollution from cars, and reduction in digital connectivity impacts upon all economic sectors. Our future vision is of a society where infrastructure engineering is undertaken with zero disruption to human activity and zero environmental impact. Robots and Autonomous systems (RAS) will play an important role in achieving this vision. Most disruption is caused by activities required to provide human operatives with safe access to infrastructure artefacts. We must dig trenches to access pipes, build gantries to access overhead cables, or close roads to protect those working on live carriageways. In contrast, RAS can operate in dangerous and challenging locations, such as inside underground pipes, or at height underneath bridges, or on live roads to perform inspection, repair, maintenance and removal tasks. This will positively disrupt the infrastructure engineering sector by improving speed, quality and timeliness of infrastructure engineering whilst reducing direct costs, economic impacts, material waste, energy usage, environmental damage, and risk to human operators. The UK is in an excellent position to exploit these benefits. We have a dense, mature infrastructure that needs frequent interventions, and we have world-leading commercial and academic expertise in RAS. But societal and technological barriers need to be overcome to achieve the full potential of RAS in Infrastructure Engineering to be realised. This white paper highlights four key action priorities: • Investment in interlinked basic research and technology transfer is required to pull advanced robotic technology into infrastructure engineering; only a small amount of UK government funded robotics research has been allocated to develop infrastructure robotics. • Investment into the whole infrastructure supply chain will be needed to support uptake, training and new business models to accommodate the autonomous future. • Industry and Universities should work together to develop test facilities where infrastructure robots can be allowed to gracefully fail, and be evaluated and improved. With a few exceptions, current test facilities are small-scale, fragmented and uncoordinated and industry will need financial and commercial incentives and protection to share, operate and manage test facilities that advance the development of robust robotic solutions for the benefit of the sector. • Infrastructure robotics should be developed in partnership with the general public and community organisations to tackle perceived challenges around loss of jobs. Programmes should be put in place to train the next generation of “robot- savvy” infrastructure engineers, including advanced apprenticeships, degree programs and doctorial training schemes."

Federal law is at odds with state law in the majority of states on the legalization and subsequent state taxation of marijuana. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have at least partially legalized marijuana. Eight of these states have legalized both medicinal and recreational use. With limited exceptions, legalized sales of marijuana are taxed. Aside from “compassionate use” of medicinal marijuana, the States have seen real business development and job creation opportunities by legalizing the marijuana trade – estimates of 250,000 new jobs by 2020 are common. State marijuana revenue measures are not harmonized today. Both the tax rates and the commercial stages at which marijuana transactions are taxed diverge widely. Rates range from zero for medicinal use (in Delaware, DC, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Oregon) to roughly 47% (for recreational marijuana, slightly less for medicinal) in Washington. For the most part, state marijuana taxes cascade with excise taxes appearing in the retail sales tax base. This paper proposes to analyze state marijuana enforcement and taxation through the lens of European value added taxes (VAT). There is a closer harmony between the EU and the US in this area than might be expected. EU VAT proposals for tax harmonization and enforcement, and applies them to the US. The proposals are technology-intensive. They integrate well with the digital track and trace systems employed by US States to control legalized marijuana. The first proposal is to place the central portion of the marijuana supply chain on a private blockchain that is shared among the states. Transactions in marijuana will be preserved in real-time (locally and centrally). Data will be shared among State authorities to aid enforcement, and tax collection. The second proposal is for a limited-purpose cryptotaxcurrency. This would be a crypto-token like VATCoin that is digitally minted by the government. For example, CALCoin. CALCoin would be the only currency allowed for marijuana-related purchases within California. Frauds related to excessive “home grown” marijuana, and the use of Dark Cloud-based Zappers in retail dispensaries are also considered."

As labor costs are high, several industries have suffered severely under the relocation of production facilities towards aspiring countries, which have managed to close the productivity and quality gap substantially. Established manufacturing companies have recognized that customers are not willing to pay large price premiums for incremental quality improvements. As a consequence, many companies from the German manufacturing industry adjust their production focusing on customized products and fast time to market. Leveraging the advantages of novel production strategies such as Agile Manufacturing and Mass Customization, manufacturing companies transform into integrated networks, in which companies unite their core competencies. Hereby, virtualization of the process- and supply-chain ensures smooth inter-company operations providing real-time access to relevant product and production information for all participating entities. Boundaries of companies deteriorate, as autonomous systems exchange data, gained by embedded systems throughout the entire value chain. By including Cyber-Physical- Systems, advanced communication between machines is tantamount to their dialogue with humans. The increasing utilization of information and communication technology allows digital engineering of products and production processes alike. Modular simulation and modeling techniques allow decentralized units to flexibly alter products and thereby enable rapid product innovation. The present article describes the developments of Industry 4.0 within the literature and reviews the associated research streams. Hereby, we analyze eight scientific journals with regards to the following research fields: Individualized production, end-to-end engineering in a virtual process chain and production networks. We employ cluster analysis to assign sub-topics into the respective research field. To assess the practical implications, we conducted face-to-face interviews with managers from the industry as well as from the consulting business using a structured interview guideline. The results reveal reasons for the adaption and refusal of Industry 4.0 practices from a managerial point of view. Our findings contribute to the upcoming research stream of Industry 4.0 and support decision- makers to assess their need for transformation towards Industry 4.0 practices."

The area has received substantial public funding and support from the late 90s from the European Union Research Framework Programmes, including the currently running Horizon 2020. We undertook data collection, clustering and analysis of 119 projects (with about 500 M€ EU funding and 890 public and private organisations) covering the area of Micro-Nano-Bio-info technologies and Systems (MNBS) to document the allocation of public money spent on research, development and innovation in this field, to identify synergies, gaps and major trends as well as to verify the alignment with the relevant EU policies and define future challenges and next opportunities for support. Methodology: The projects, funded through several topics of the EC programmes, e.g. Bio-electronics, Biophotonics, Nanomedicine and Healthcare & Well-Being, have been clustered through a semi-automated process based on text mining, using RapidMiner software, with the text describing the projects and their tasks as the input. Text mining-based clustering is grounded in the words contained in the documents provided, and includes basically 2 steps: (i) document pre-processing and (ii) document clustering based on the word frequencies. The hierarchical clustering obtained provide us information related to the proximity of the projects with regard to the meaningful words related to the technologies, processes, applications, etc., which have been kept. This type of grouping provides certainty that projects are grouped with the closest projects in terms of overall content (e.g. objectives, tasks and technologies involved). Results: Classification: Eleven differentiated project categories have been defined, each containing from 6 to 17 projects. These categories can be further re-grouped in broader categories in several ways depending on the purpose, e.g. considering the link to either in-vivo (patient-centred devices) or in-vitro (portable devices and systems and analytical detection platforms) applications, to the level of portability (portable devices vs. platforms), or to the manufacturing importance. Participating (EU and non-EU) organisations include research and academic (37%), private companies (56%), end-users e.g. hospitals or clinical related institutions (4,7%) as well as public authorities and endusers associations in health, food and environment sectors (2,3%). Participation: The participants come from European countries and from Russia, Australia, Japan and the United States. The EU funding is spread all over Europe, though higher concentration is observed in the Western part of Europe. Driving forces: the large majority of projects is driven by two main requirements i.e. avoid the use of specialized laboratory-based (mainly hospital-centred), skilled labour-handled, expensive and time-consuming bio-samples and data analysis; and achieve lower cost, quasi-real-time monitoring or analysis using non-specialized infrastructures, at the Point of Care/Need (out-of-lab). Achievements and Challenges: overall the projects have delivered significant technological progress beyond the state-of-the-art and in some cases integrated prototypes have been validated at the laboratory and in fewer cases tested in real application environments. However, further R&D effort is needed in order to achieve better and compatible interfaces, higher system integration and technology readiness level, better connectivity, efficient manufacturing processes & technologies and validation in real application conditions. Additionally, a critical collaborative effort should be put on effective technology translation of research into new products, speeding up product development, market introduction and cost reduction. This should encompass product design, supply chain setup, user targeting, clinical validation, manufacturing and commercial roll-out. Conclusion: The projects′ portfolio analysis allowed sizing the EU funding and clustering of MNBS research and innovation activities, as well as identifying synergies, major trends, gaps and lessons to be learned for future public investment. Supporting further system integration and validation in real life environments as well as the creation of collaborative interdisciplinary platforms and innovation ecosystems will strongly contribute to new business and markets. It will accelerate the digitization of the European industry in key sectors like healthcare, food and security and support innovation through the full supply chains, thus will positively impact the EU's single market fit for the digital age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers."

Literature review shows that the volume and quality of data enabling situational awareness during construction projects is increasing with the use of new technologies, such as indoor positioning systems and other applications of Internet of Things (IoT). However, these information streams have been used individually so far. BIM as the interface integrating different streams of situational awareness information can result in better data-driven construction management and production. This study suggests that using BIM in 3D visualization of the indoor positioning of construction resources (workers, material, and equipment) enables visual management based on situation awareness on construction project activities. Better situational awareness of construction resources on-site based on visualization in BIM can improve the identification and elimination of waste and the identification of workflow interruptions, potentially permitting better planning and increasing productivity. The study suggests further steps for empirical research to prototype the concept and validate it with industry partners and practitioners."

In the first essay, we analytically study the effects of upstream and downstream mergers on suppliers, retailers and consumers, in an oligopolistic market. We start with a benchmark case where mergers do not generate any synergy. By assuming that firms compete in Bertrand or Cournot fashion, we compare the effects of an upstream merger with a downstream one. We find that upstream (respectively, downstream) mergers always benefit the merging firms, while adversely affecting their dependent downstream (respectively, upstream) supply chain partners; non-dependent suppliers and non-dependent retailers also benefit from such horizontal mergers. Moreover, an upstream merger is more detrimental to consumers than a downstream merger. We then analyze three extended models: (i) In a case where mergers generate synergies through economies of scale at both levels, merging firms still benefit while non-merging competitors suffer a loss in profit.

Blockchain presents an exciting opportunity to shift business interactions through smart contracts, distributed ledgers, improved transparency measures, and more secure data practices. The technology provides mechanisms for storing massive amounts of information, allowing for improved data analysis through collection of ""big data,"" and its distributed nature allows for greater information sharing among stakeholders. In theory, blockchain offers a new conceptualization of farm-to-table and has the potential to transform an increasingly globalized agri-food industry. Notably, multiple blockchain ""projects"" seeking to optimize the agri-food industry have recently gained traction with partnerships like that of IBM and Maerk (utilizing Hyperledger, an open-source blockchain hosted by the Linux Foundation), which are employing the technology to strengthen traceability processes, bolster food safety measures, and increase consumer knowledge about food provenance. The United States is grappling with policing the technology beyond its popular functionality as digital currency. While these projects seem promising, it is crucial to consider how the emerging technology will be regulated and how these regulations may interfere with the aims of ambitious projects. Examining both federal level and state-level legislation and regulation, this research adds to the existing body of literature on blockchain technology, which is heavily focused on evaluating the merits of different blockchain ""platforms."" The goal is to provide a better understanding of how regulatory measures may create obstacles to agri-food leveraging blockchain in lucrative ways and to determine whether the current U.S. legal approach to the emerging technology embodies a ""hands-off"" mentality. Moving forward, this research aims to monitor shifts in the regulatory environment to better understand how the technology will interact with regulation.

Also, the blurring line between product and service is resulting in bundling of product-service mix offering by the market players. As the gap between goods and services is almost gone and a new era of bundling of goods and services has started, there is a need for development of a services classification scheme that would enable managers of service firms to relate their firms with respect to their marketing and supply chain strategies and actions with goods industries as they share common characteristics in the 21st century marketing. A majority of past literature reviews of service classification systems only review either the classification of services or classification of service delivery processes. Taking cognizance of the changing nature and dynamics of value offerings in marketplace, the model presented herein applies to the classification of services for all goods and service providers. The authors propose a new service classification matrix that provides a classification of services based on customer interface or user service-provider interface and service delivery processes. Strategic implications of the proposed matrix for marketing insights, innovation and delivery are also implicated for better planning and use by various stakeholders in the public and private sector.

The central part is an empirical analysis of global trade patterns and the shifts which puts developing countries on an unfavorable perspective. Since global demand for fossil energy like oil, natural gas or coal is shrinking in the developed countries this leads to problems in the producer and exporter countries. Similarly the end of the supercycle in raw materials in particular metals had an effect amplifying this development. The same problem is visible in the area of agricultural products. Furthermore consumer expenditure in global tourism industries from developed countries is on a retreat. Even the high-tech strategy of countries heavily invested in the production and export of ICT goods suffers from a digital deflation of their commodity prices due to the increase of performance associated with lower prices. So many areas where developing countries in the past had the specialization pattern are becoming inferior areas considering the long-term perspectives. Recycling of materials, energy savings, higher standards of quality control of the supply chain of agricultural products and textiles, etc. put developing countries on an unfavorable development path if they get stuck in their current specialization patterns. A review of the current debate of the crisis of globalization offers little hope that this structural impediment for a recovery of global growth in trade is under way. Instead there is a rising skepticism that policy makers return to more inward looking protectionist policies. Without accepting that the structural changes are the fundamental factors causing the stalemate of globalization many recipes to overcome the stagnation of globalization will not succeed in the end."

Findings from a mail survey show that over a quarter of B2B SMEs in the UK are currently using SNS to achieve brand objectives, the most popular of which is to attract new customers. On the other hand, the most significant barrier is the lack of perceived relevance for particular sectors. Notably, the overwhelming majority of users do not adopt any metrics to assess SNS effectiveness.

Approach: The report is based on a review of relevant literature to define ‘convergence’ and what regulatory issues it triggers. In internal meetings with the OPTA team the insights were discussed to allow effective scoping of the issues (technical, economic and societal) to be researched further. A limited number of expert interviews were used to validate findings. On the basis of this general understanding of the issues three detailed case studies were conducted of the market governance and regulation in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Korea. The cases were selected because of their distinct characteristics, and aimed to disclose different regulatory approaches to allow insightful assessment and comparison. The case study process involved a review of policy documents, presentations, scientific literature, existing case studies, and annual reports as well as interviews with local stakeholders and experts. Convergence: In the past, broadcast and telecommunications were clearly separate markets, based on different technologies, with distinct governance and regulatory frameworks. Broadcasting often had a strong public-sector interest, driven by concerns about free speech, diversity of supply, decency, programming (cultural content, sports, major events), advertisements, objective information provision, protection of minors, etc. Public broadcasters were supervised by content boards or similar institutions ensuring that the supply of content services complied with the desired societal objectives. Through media ownership restrictions and other rules these were also extended to commercial broadcasting services. Telecommunications markets were ruled by economic and technical issues, including network access; the public interest was the derived goal of ensuring affordable services to everyone. Telecommunication markets, which were mostly liberalised in the 1990s, usually had a regulator to ensure that neither the natural monopoly nor the technical characteristics of incumbent operator(s) would be used to restrict network access or otherwise be exploited to create and abuse significant market power. Through a number of technological advances – especially the increase of processing speed, storage capacity, transmission speed, compression techniques and standardisation – this well-organised and segregated situation changed, allowing for a single or similar set of services to be offered over different platforms (e.g. over cable, satellite, and telecommunication networks), and for the bundling of distinct services onto a single platform (triple and quadruple play). The process of this change is usually referred to as ‘convergence.’ It challenged the previous modus vivendi because new forms of competition by unregulated players tended to undercut the implicit subsidies of the old model and to disrupt long-term governance relations. This convergence trend is painting a new and much more diffused picture, which can be (temporarily) captured in an image of an integrated ‘Information delivery’ chain (Figure A); running from the information (or content) source, through publishers and broadcasters, search agents, connection provides, and devices to the ultimate consumer of the information. In the current ‘converging’ situation none of these elements of the delivery chain are stable and many of the established players are experiencing the impact of disruptive technologies and business models. New services and new entrants are emerging, whilst established players are vertically integrating or even exiting the market. It should be noted that this is a very dynamic situation in which suppliers to one market consistently try to expand into adjoining fields and absorb the market that exists between the functions. Information sources try to bypass publishers by gaining access to search agents and the consuming public. Producers/publishers try to integrate forward by providing search capabilities of their own and sometimes also by offering competing information sources. Soft- and hardware producers try to enter the information delivery chain in the understanding that this is the area where value added will grow. Search engines are investing in mobile devices and operating systems. Connection providers, who realize that the value-added of transmission services can only decrease as bandwidth supply increases, are actively trying to integrate upwards in to additional search and publishing/producing activities. Thus the chain should be seen as a heuristic to help visualize the new converged reality, whilst acknowledging that in practice it is neither linear, nor clearly defined."

This integration of connectivity enables manufacturing systems access to computational resources, such as cloud computing, digital twin, and blockchain. The connected manufacturing systems are expected to be more efficient, sustainable and cost-effective. However, the extensive connectivity also increases the vulnerability of physical components. The attack surface of a connected manufacturing environment is greatly enlarged. Machines, products and tools could be targeted by cyber-physical attacks via the network. Among many emerging security concerns, this research focuses on the intrusion detection of cyber-physical attacks. The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is used to monitor cyber-attacks in the computer security domain. For cyber-physical attacks, however, there is limited work. Currently, the IDS cannot effectively address cyber-physical attacks in manufacturing system: (i) the IDS takes time to reveal true alarms, sometimes over months; (ii) manufacturing production life-cycle is shorter than the detection period, which can cause physical consequences such as defective products and equipment damage; (iii) the increasing complexity of network will also make the detection period even longer. This gap leaves the cyber-physical attacks in manufacturing to cause issues like over-wearing, breakage, defects or any other changes that the original design didn’t intend. A review on the history of cyber-physical attacks, and available detection methods are presented. The detection methods are reviewed in terms of intrusion detection algorithms, and alert correlation methods. The attacks are further broken down into a taxonomy covering four dimensions with over thirty attack scenarios to comprehensively study and simulate cyber-physical attacks. A new intrusion detection and correlation method was proposed to address the cyber-physical attacks in CMS. The detection method incorporates IDS software in cyber domain and machine learning analysis in physical domain. The correlation relies on a new similarity-based cyber-physical alert correlation method. Four experimental case studies were used to validate the proposed method. Each case study focused on different aspects of correlation method performance. The experiments were conducted on a security-oriented manufacturing testbed established for this research at Syracuse University. The results showed the proposed intrusion detection and alert correlation method can effectively disclose unknown attack, known attack and attack interference that causes false alarms. In case study one, the alarm reduction rate reached 99.1%, with improvement of detection accuracy from 49.6% to 100%. The case studies also proved the proposed method can mitigate false alarms, detect attacks on multiple machines, and attacks from the supply chain. This work contributes to the security domain in cyber-physical manufacturing systems, with the focus on intrusion detection. The dataset collected during the experiments has been shared with the research community. The alert correlation methodology also contributes to cyber-physical systems, such as smart grid and connected vehicles, which requires enhanced security protection in today’s connected world."

While strong growth in China and other developing regions is impacting energy and steel prices, it also is causing global shortages of some mechanical components essential to industrial production such as bearings. Needing to purchase these parts, some buyers have resorted to using unfamiliar sources that promise brand-name products but do not deliver the real thing. Inevitably, these counterfeit products fail. Failure can cause a production line to come down, or even more serious consequences, such as an accident that causes bodily injury or death. Bearings manufacturers and distributors say such reports of fake bearings being passed off as genuine are rising, although they are unsure of the breadth of the problem right now. What's more, manufacturers and distributors alike say it is especially hard to distinguish between a genuine bearing and a fake. Advances in graphic design and digital technology make it nearly impossible to tell a counterfeit just by looking at the packaging. For their part, purchasing professionals have counterfeiting on their list of concerns and realize they have a role to play to ensure that fake products do not enter the supply chain."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on supply chain management (SCM) practices in small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) and outlines the key insights. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes a literature-based research that has sought understand the issues of SCM for SMEs. The methodology is based on critical review of 77 research papers from high-quality, international refereed journals. Mainly, issues are explored under three categories – supply chain integration, strategy and planning and implementation. This has supported the development of key constructs and propositions. Findings – The research outcomes are three fold. Firstly, paper summarizes the reported literature and classifies it based on their nature of work and contributions. Second, paper demonstrates the overall approach towards the development of constructs, research questions, and investigative questions leading to key proposition for the further research. Lastly, paper outlines the key findings and insights gained. Practical implications – Survival of SMEs will be determined first and foremost by their ability to provide/produce more, at less cost, in less time, with few ''defects''. The key to this is effective SCM. The issue is much explored in the context of large enterprises but less attention is paid to SMEs. Paper aims to surface out some facts for the same. Originality/value The paper reports-classifies the literature and development of construct and propositions."

Thesis A Methodology for Early Exploration of TSV Interconnects in 3D Stacked ICs Radhika S. Jagtap Abstract Planar scaling of semiconductor ICs for achieving higher integration seems to be on the brink of saturation. As an alternative solution, three-dimensional (3D) integration follows a more than Moore strat- egy in which circuit layers are stacked vertically. Although, 3D in- tegration technology has moved from Lab to Fab, a complete supply chain is yet to fall in place. Due to the lack of a fully automated 3D IC design flow, realistic performance estimation at an early stage becomes imperative to ensure an efficient end-to-end design cycle. In this the- sis, an approach is shown for early performance and cost estimation of a 3D stacked IC in order to allow critical technology parameters to influence system design decisions. A novel methodology is proposed which explores Through-Silicon-Via (TSV) placement topologies for a 2-tier vertical interconnect across two performance corners of the TSV technology. It estimates electrical performance and TSV area penalty which are then translated to system design metrics. The methodol- ogy is applicable to digital ICs and offers flexibility in selection of the CMOS technology node and the 3D stacking granularity. The implementation of the methodology in SystemC efficiently achieves parameterizability and enables its integration into a high-level system simulation framework. By applying the methodology to a case of a 7-port 3D router it was found that, the most preferred TSV place- ment topology in terms of performance and cost is Isolated for 45 nm technology node and Shielded for 32 nm technology node.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how Woolworths, a South African retail chain, evaluates and controls its sustainable business practices using economic, environmental and social indicators. Design/methodology/approach – A content analysis of Woolworths' comprehensive 2008-2011 sustainability and annual reports examined how this retail chain evaluates and implements its sustainable business practices. Findings – The results indicate that such indicators play a significant role in evaluating and implementing various Woolworths' business practices aimed at sustainability. In addition, Woolworths' comprehensive governance system ensures that its sustainable business practices are implemented and targets achieved. Research limitations/implications – The case study demonstrates that businesses can remain profitable, while at the same time protecting the natural environment and striving for sustainable business practices. Practical implications – This example demonstrates how government influence, institutional mechanisms and senior management commitment to a project ultimately has gone some way to minimise barriers to the adoption of sustainable practices. Originality/value – The example provides not only a seed of knowledge for others in retailing, but also guidance to both practice in general and theory in the field of sustainable business practices. It demonstrates how an organization has taken strategic action, extended this beyond the firm's boundaries and into the supply chain.

Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 200 Norwegian companies with informants mainly related to the SCM function and from top management. Findings – The findings clearly indicate that SMEs give less attention to planning and control methods than LEs. SMEs are less satisfied with the methods applied; less concerned with methods supporting SCM on product quality, rationalisation of operations and capital cost rationalisation; less focused on system integration with other actors in the supply chain; and less focused on EDI and e-based solutions. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses primarily on managerial components and excluded logistics structures and business processes that are more or less inter-related. Practical implications – Horizontal cooperation or vertical integration can reduce the information technology gap by sharing planning and control systems. The suppliers of support systems should consider delivering complete "" turn-key "" solutions for revitalising the supply chain functions, specifically targeted towards SMEs. Originality/value – The strength of this study is that it has been able to identify systematic differences between LEs and SMEs across sectors with respect to how SCM challenges are met."

By exploiting unused timing margin, produced by state-of-the-art worst-case designs, power consumption is minimized. Timing information of the circuit is obtained by in situ delay monitors (Pre-Error flip-flops), detecting late-arriving signals (pre-errors) in critical paths. Based on the occurrence of pre-errors, the voltage is adjusted by a low-overhead control unit connected to the on-chip voltage regulator. As the voltage is adapted during normal circuit operation (on-line), the randomness of the applied input pattern has to be considered. We developed a Markov chain model, based on transistor level simulations, to describe the resulting statistics of the closed-loop voltage control. With this model, the risk of overcritical voltage reductions and the effect of global and local variations on the closed-loop control can be analyzed. For an arithmetic circuit, synthesized in an industrial 65nm design-flow, an average power saving of 23% (including all overheads) is achieved for very low error rates below 1E-11. © World Scientific Publishing Company."

"" -Peter F. Drucker Marketing affects everyone, every day, and in all areas of life. It is the key driver for bringing people goods and services they desire, and includes many different industrial activities, including marketing research, product development, organisation of resource distribution, pricing strategies, press and public relations, advertising and personal selling, a long supply chain that ends in "" the sale "" . Marketing influences more than just retailers and buyers, but even non-buyers, via impacts on the common environment. But to distill it simply, marketing's main objectives can be identified as the following: "" To achieve the highest possible consumption rates, to achieve maximum customer perceptions of satisfaction, to provide consumers with the widest selection possible in the most cost efficient manner, and to maximize the quality of lifestyle "" (Peter Drucker, 2006). Many believe the highest ideal must be to improve the quality of life, but as world famous management consultant Peter Drucker noted, the primary aim of marketing is to better understand customers in order to sell them more products. That is why marketers, the actual people funding the marketing industry, measure the success of campaigns in terms of units moved, not lives improved: "" MINI's introduction into the worldwide market ended in 2002 with more that 144,000 cars sold, which went beyond the expecta-tions of BMW Group and continues significantly to our success "" (Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, 2003). What drives the sales of so many MINIs? Is it so well made that success comes easily? Or is it something more that they sell to consumers, for example the spirit or lifestyle? These and other questions will now be explored on the next page of this paper."

When such cameras are married with emerging, desktop 'photogrammetric' software packages, the close range photogrammetric community is faced with many new challenges and opportunities. The dramatic changes in the technological arena are matched by a rapidly changing business environment in which concepts such as 'Partnering' and 'Supply chain management' have become key themes. As organizations of all sizes seek to thrive within this new business landscape, there appears to be a willingness to think more flexibly about the client-supplier relationship and the sharing of risks and rewards. This, in turn, has encouraged the development of highly customized measurement solutions across a wide range of market sectors. In each of these solutions the emphasis is not on a generic photogrammetric product, but on a highly tailored system tightly coupled to existing workflows, and focused on the specific needs of the client. Such systems pose particular challenges to their designers, since they are frequently operated by users with relatively little photogrammetric background and yet must always meet the challenging requirement of producing an output which is 'fit for purpose'. Thus this paper hopes to show how novel megapixel imaging systems can be configured to deliver flexible measurement systems capable of millimetric level accuracy within the challenging engineering environments typical of the nuclear and process industries (hence the microsievert component of the title)."

from product-centric towards those in which a higher degree of service is associated with the product a company’s business ecosystem ‒ the collaborative network needed to build value for the customer ‒ often becomes more complex. When considering the collaborative possibilities, firms can find it challenging to identify and compare the potential value created by alternative strategic actions such as radical new partnerships and partnering arrangements. To support capability development, strategic thinking is shifting to include a broader approach to understanding and conceptualizing business ecosystems. The Institute for Manufacturing (IfM) and IfM Education and Consultancy Services Ltd. are applying a novel way to allow managers to visualize and understand their firm’s external complexity, which we refer to as business ecosystem value mapping. The technique has been used in strategic workshops with industry partners. This paper includes a case study of one such workshop, focusing on how the industry partner deepened their understanding of value exchange in their business ecosystem. This understanding was critical to the workshop purpose: to decide whether and how to proceed with a tender offering. From an inauspicious starting point ‒ the firm considered itself relatively uncompetitive in relation to the tender ‒ the workshop led to the identification of eight new value creation opportunities from which four propositions were selected to form the basis of an offering. The partner’s subsequent tender offering was successful. Following acceptance, the partner cited a number of these propositions as the reasons why the offering was chosen. The paper seeks to illuminate how the two-day workshop process, built on strong preparation to ensure that the right strategic questions were addressed, developed understanding and application of value creation and exchange in offerings based on collaborative ecosystems. We then suggest some implications for further work."

But it doesn't have to be. Illustration by Mark Matcho Many benchmarks of corporate practice start by looking at successful companies. But a recent Booz & Company survey took the opposite tack. We decided to study the biggest losers: companies that, in one way or another, had seen their fortunes go south over a 10-year period. We had gone through this exercise once before. In 2004, when the Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom scandals were fresh, we surveyed thousands of public companies and determined that, contrary to prevailing wisdom, it was not compliance issues that were most responsible for destroying shareholder value. That distinction went to the mismanagement of strategic risks — those risks embedded in the top-level decisions made by the executive team, such as what products and services to offer, whether to outsource manufacturing, or what acquisitions to make. Our 2012 survey revealed the same culprit, and suggested that it still leads to significant value destruction. Making matters worse, the sources of strategic risk have increased. Accelerating technology development is forcing the rapid adoption of new products, services, and business models; digital information is making organizations more vulnerable to theft and loss; supply chain disruptions quickly ripple around the globe, affecting both companies and customers; consumer connectivity via social networks can broadcast missteps instantaneously to millions of people worldwide; and natural, political, or regulatory shocks can reverberate widely. Companies must learn how to effectively anticipate and hedge against these and other risks in order to survive. To be sure, during the past decade, companies have steadily dialed up their focus on risk, in part as a reaction to the requirements of the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. But they have usually done so with a bottom-up approach that has proven flawed. Individual functions such as accounting, finance, and compliance have improved risk controls. Meanwhile, executives have made their enterprise risk management (ERM) teams accountable for identifying and evaluating the interconnected risks facing their companies."

Abstract Purpose – Compared with the private sector, the public sector's procurement process differs in several respects. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the possibility for mutual learning and the value between the public and private sectors and also to identify both drivers and barriers for benchmarks between the two sectors. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on in-depth literature reviews of comparisons between private and public procurements. The paper is, furthermore, derived from two case studies: one in a chain perspective and another that concerns public-private innovation. Findings – Extant literature contains limited contributions that compare public procurement practice with private purchasing practice. Using tendering to regulate procurement is troublesome and may hamper the possibility to learn and gain value measured on a broader scale. Wider collaboration may provide more possibilities to learn and gain value. Research limitations/implications – The empirical part of the paper rests on two case studies. The procurement process of a single item has been studied as have new cooperation modes between the public and private sectors. Practical implications – The paper provides supply chain management (staff) input as to examples in which comparisons of procurement and purchasing processes might add value. The paper argues that both sectors can learn from each other. Originality/value – This paper is the first report about an in-depth literature review of comparisons of public procurement with private purchase, and it is the first to empirically analyze a chain of relations from private-private to private-public. It further addresses new ways to perceive the EU Directive of public tendering."

The main objective is to disseminate, as widely as possible, the results of IRRI' s research. There is also a strong push to provide free open access to these information resources through modes convenient to researchers in both developing and developed countries. Certain instruments for open access (OA) are already in place at IRRI, including links to full-text publications posted on the Institute's Web site (http:// www.irri.org/). especially via the Library branch site (http://ricelib.irri.cgiar.org/). the Rice Knowledge Bank (http://www.knowledaebank.irri.org/). and Rice Publications Archive (http://rice-publications.irri.org/). The joint initiatives of the Library and the Institute's main science publishing units, particularly Communication and Publications Services and the Training Center, typify a convergence of practices to overcome hurdles to OA implementation. This paper explores how the links in IRRI's scholarly publishing chain, bridging information management and publishing, can effectively deliver public goods (knowledge about rice, in this case) to the intended primary users -researchers and extenslonists in the national agricultural research and extension systems (NARES) in developing countries. It also discusses publishing models for delivering public goods generated by an international research organization. To meet its mission, IRRI must employ various demand-supply models to disseminate information. Open access publishing is one model to adopt but first, the onus is on the Institute to overcome issues such as intellectual property rights, funding, and connectivity. IRRI's donors, NARES partners, governments, and rice farmers and consumers expect it to create and share information for the common good, and it strives to convert its resources into electronic format for delivery over the Internet. However, not all its stakeholders are connected. To create impact, IRRI must deliver information through whatever appropriate form, be it cutting-edge digital versions or traditional hard-copy books. This paper discusses this dilemma and hopes to encourage further research and thought on open access publishing."

For Ukrainian entrepreneurs, this test has complicated the already difficult economic situation. This article analyzes how the priority of business development threats has changed since the beginning of the pandemic in the world. With the onset of the pandemic, the greatest threat to business development was the risk associated with human capital, which outpaced the risk of the supply chain and the return to territorialism. Contrary to the global trend, in Ukraine this year the risk of staff shortages has moved from the first line, where it has been for the last few years, to the fourth. In particular, a characteristic feature of the labor market in Ukraine has been the large scale of hidden unemployment with a relatively small scale of growth of officially registered unemployment. Moreover, the Ukrainian labor market was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in several areas. First, the development of the situation on the Ukrainian labor market is influenced by changes in the segment of the national economy, the operation of which is focused on the domestic market of Ukraine. Secondly, in that segment of the national economy, the functioning of which is focused on the foreign (world) market. Third, the development of the situation on the Ukrainian labor market is influenced by changes in the current situation with the direct migration of labor from Ukraine abroad. After all, Ukraine is a fairly large net exporter of labor and labor services on the world market. This approach to the analysis of the Ukrainian labor market in terms of the impact of endogenous (external) factors on its development in a pandemic provides an opportunity to build more reasonable scenarios for the transformation of this market depending on the further course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the world. The pandemic has led to a rethinking of the urgency and importance of digital transformation. Company executives mostly point to the acceleration of digitalization during quarantine.

By means of experimental measurements on an FPGA target we can clearly identify late transitions, single glitches and double glitches as possible manifestations of metastability. Some of these behaviors are unexpected as they do not follow from the traditional modeling theory. We also study the dependence of metastable behavior on supply voltage.

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to seek to investigate performance outcomes of vendor managed inventory (VMI) from a buyer's perspective and enablers for its successful application. Design/methodology/approach – Structural equation modelling through Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to identify relationships between four enablers (information systems, information sharing, information quality, and relationship quality), perceived VMI success, and three outcomes (cost reductions, customer service, and supply chain control). Findings – Buyer-perceived VMI success is impacted by the quality of the buyer-supplier relationship, the quality of the IT-system and the intensity of information sharing, but not by the actual quality of the information shared. Furthermore, VMI leads to three performance outcomes: higher customer service levels, improved supply chain control and, to a lesser extent, cost reduction. Research limitations/implications – Although theory stipulates a positive impact of high quality information on the success of VMI, this study shows that the effect of information quality is limited in practice. Practical implications – The results of the survey show that purchasing managers who invest in the relationship with their suppliers and a good IT infrastructure are more likely to get better results from a VMI implementation. Furthermore, this paper shows that while most managers expect major cost reductions when implementing VMI, benefits primarily come from improved service levels. Originality/value – The study provides empirical evidence of why VMI in practice does not achieve all the benefits claimed in theory."

For such business model pursuits, electronic intermediation possesses the ability to cultivate new marketplaces and restructure supply chains. The economic literature identifies four distinct intermediary roles, specifically: (i) information and (ii) logistics management, (iii) transaction securitization, as well as (iv) insurance/market-making and liquidity management. Research notes that electronic intermediaries, while possessing clear advantages in their ability to manage information, face greater challenges in allowing parties to benefit from the facilitation of more complex coordination activities, namely transaction securitization in addition to insurance/market-making and liquidity management. In an effort to better understand pursuit of functional intermediary roles, our analysis of data collected on 182 electronic intermediaries explores relationships between intermediation roles and profitability. Business models relying solely upon the provision of information management are likely to realize lower levels of profitability. Alternately, the intermediary roles of logistics management as well as insurance/market-making and liquidity management realize higher levels of profitability. Moreover, when comparing commodity- and service-based intermediaries, the provision of logistics management on the part of commodity-based firms sees higher levels of profitability, with insurance and liquidity provisions associated with greater profitability for both commodity- and service-based firms. Finally, when contrasting traditional firms expanding operations in digital markets with Internet pure-plays, we find transaction securitization functions increase the likelihood of realizing greater profitability for non-Internet pure-plays. © 2011 The Authors Decision Sciences Journal © 2011 Decision Sciences Institute."

Abstract Purpose – There is a paucity of literature considering horizontal collaboration among grocery retailers, suppliers, and third-party logistics (3PL) providers. This paper seeks to investigate benefits of and barriers to the use of fourth-party logistics (4PL) management as a catalyst for horizontal collaboration. Design/methodology/approach – Three suppliers, three logistics service providers (LSPs), and one grocery retailer participated in semi-structured interviews for this exploratory qualitative study. Findings – Large LSPs can establish 4PL management but the significant investment required to do so is a deterrent. Interviewees believed 4PL would negatively influence the grocery retailer-supplier dynamic but simultaneously would provide key potential benefits. Retaining supply chain control means more to grocery retailers than cost efficiencies realised through horizontal collaboration. Research limitations/implications – Fierce competition among major grocery chains means that most are unwilling to participate in studies of their systems, which restricts the research scope. Practical implications – Some stakeholders want deeper integration into grocery supply networks, and the 4PL model could apply to diverse sectors and circumstances. This study shows that barriers to such integration are created by power plays among lead stakeholders in grocery retailing that inhibit horizontal collaboration regardless of cost or other benefits. Originality/value – The study investigates an under-researched aspect of horizontal supply chain collaboration in the highly relevant retail grocery sector: a high volume, mass market industry that requires an enormous logistics infrastructure and highly embedded networks of relationships."

Abstract Successful companies encounter unique competitive challenges. However, there are several product strategy initiatives that are relevant to all organizations seeking to develop market-driven strategies. Key initiatives include the leveraging the business design, recognizing the growth mandate, developing market vision, achieving a capabilities/value match, exploring strategic relationships, building strong brands, brand leveraging, and recognizing the advantages of proactive cannibalization. We propose a product strategy agenda for review by executives in identifying which initiatives should be assessed relative to the needs of their organization. Notwithstanding the topical importance of relationship marketing processes, customer satisfaction management and supply chain collaborations to control logistics, it is apparent that many companies build strategies around pivotal products. Companies such as Coca-Cola and Intel formulate their strategies around key products in their portfolio. Recently, several important trends have emerged in the marketplace such as the blurring of market boundaries, escalating customer diversity, and increasing global competitive threats. These trends create an impetus for executives to develop and adopt market-driven product strategies, which are integrated with relationship and supply chain strategies, to deliver superior customer value."

Most of the supply will come from the oil industry, if we do our job right. As demand rises, the complexities also increase.The prime value of data captured through continuous surveillance is letting the reservoirs talk. Reservoirs talk through information and knowledge derived from data capture, analysis, and integration. This results in proper understanding and prognosis through applying better analytics and, thus, improving the decision-making process. In this way, we will be able to extend the lives of mature fields, discover new fields, improve refining and manufacturing efficiency, enable smart awareness, optimize corporate-scale operations, dynamically respond to supply and demand, integrate business and support functions across supply chain and geography, manage proactive growth, integrate information among all assets, and implement greater intelligence.Slow Pace of Automation and InstrumentationThere is no question that smarter work flows enabled by digital automation increase profitability. To realize such opportunities, industry has been deploying hardware for sensing and actuation in the last 3 decades, in combination with data-driven modeling and remote collaboration. Many major oil fields around the world would not be producing today if not for opportune field automation.However, building such capability across the globe has not been solid enough. Ninety percent of worldwide mid- to large-size operators (i.e., 100,000 BOPD or more) have embraced oilfield automation in the simplest form; however, less than 1% of such equivalent production has a consistent application of data-to-knowledge transformation. The slow acceptance of the technology is because of the short-term gratification from profitable and low-risk operations, lack of knowledge of the added value from related technologies, and management blindness.What Is Next?Many business and digital corporations claim that between 100 billion and 200 billion devices could be connected by 2020. Young engineers may not understand why it is not possible to access any real-time well data from his mobile device, understand its past performance, and allow the simulation of multiple scenarios to see the impact of decisions. With close to a billion people connected at any moment playing online strategy games, how is it possible that our industry is still so far behind with respect to the gaming philosophy?

The customer experiences a need, shops to satisfy the need, and then consumes or uses the product purchased (I need shoes, I buy shoes, I wear them). The vocabulary of retailing reflects this model, assuming in particular that shopping is the central component of this model. Marketers will talk about shopping trips, shopping missions, shopping baskets, shopping lists, and destination trips. What’s more, current practice for the most part still rests on the idea that many decisions on which particular product to buy are made in the store — whether physical or online. Hence, brands engage in an arms race of persuasion and hard-sell tactics (prices, promos, presence) at the point-of-sale order to sway the customer when she is ready to transact. Insight Center The Global Digital Economy Sponsored by Accenture Strategies for growth in a connected world. But winning in retailing today is less and less about control of the shopping experience because there is no longer a clearly defined shopping stage. The model is changing as new technologies allow people to bring the purchase of the product that satisfies their need closer to their first perception of it. And this makes the perception of the need — rather than the shop — the stage that marketers need to control. This paradigm shift — and it really is that — is apparent in three ways: Instant purchasing. To begin with, consumers increasingly transact right when the demand (need) occurs. Today, when you discover in the shower that you have run out of hair conditioner, you can order a new bottle through Amazon Prime then and there. And tomorrow, perhaps, when you’re watching a streamed movie or browsing Pinterest, you’ll will able to point and click on a character’s suit or tie and buy it right away — without ever going to a retailer’s site. This change obviously simplifies consumers’ lives but it is also rendering the traditional retailer store largely obsolete. Automated purchasing. We’re increasingly seeing many types of product being purchased automatically — Amazon’s Dash button is an obvious move in this direction. The move to “intelligent” products is another. The latest generation of Whirlpool washing machines, for example, can autonomously order a pre-specified amount of washing detergent after a set number of cycles. Especially for fast-moving-consumer-goods, this development will also significantly push non-store based sales. Subscription-based purchasing. The growing popularity of subscription-based platforms are also undermining the primacy of the store as the main customer touchpoint. In categories as different as music (Spotify), video (Netflix), transportation (Zipcar), underwear (MeUndies) home delivery restaurant meals (Delivery Hero), groceries (Blue Apron) news (Blendle), and razors (Harry’s or Dollar Shave Club) a subscriber can either pick conveniently and immediately from a broad selection at the moment of need, or simply sign up and receive a regular delivery — without engaging directly with any other intermediary. It’s not so difficult to see the subscription model evolving in other ways (which is perhaps why there are so many new entrants in this area). In this environment, shopping as a discrete activity in a given place and time takes a distinct back seat. Rather, the transaction becomes an ambient activity that is executed everywhere (at home, on the go, at work, in leisure) and anytime. In addition, all steps in the entire cycle of “need occurrence,” “shopping” and “actual consumption” become more and more naturally integrated into the daily mental and physical routine of consumers. As a physical store is largely superfluous in this emerging purchase process, the traditional value-adding functions of the store-based retailer (creating an assortment of products, providing product information, enabling the transaction, providing physical distribution services) are also called into question. In a digital economy, then, there may be relatively little need for stores as we traditionally understand them, and the retail business will change to reflect this new reality.

Abstract Purpose – The paper's aim is to evaluate the changing patterns of defence requirements and their implications on supply chains and relationships within the UK defence industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds a case study on the UK defence industry comprising 22 face-to-face interviews with senior management from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and major first tier suppliers, as well as senior officers in the British armed forces. Findings – The results suggest that there are major changes currently taking place that have major impacts on defence supply relationships. The authors find a consensus in the industry concerning a shift towards through-life management (TLM), where major equipment platforms are kept in service for several decades. TLM is widely acknowledged as requiring much closer partnerships in the defence supply chain, in which suppliers assume much greater responsibilities in areas such as in-service support and maintenance. Yet the findings with MoD and suppliers reveal different perceptions of the feasibility and practical implications of the proposed changes. Practical implications – Product-service specific capabilities need to be developed especially in areas such as accurate lifecycle costing. The development of integrated supply partnerships requires greater emphasis on openness, risk and reward sharing, trust and long-term commitment in supplier relationships. There is also a need for early supplier involvement to ensure not only design for manufacture, but design for maintainability and logistics, instigated and managed by the customer (i.e. MoD). Originality/value – The analysis demonstrates the importance of adopting a through-life perspective when considering industrial contexts characterised by very long product lifecycles. This study shows that a through-life perspective creates a blurring of the boundary between customers and suppliers, and increases long-term supplier responsibility. This gives rise to new considerations, such as sophisticated risk and rewards sharing mechanisms, design for maintainability, and technology insertion."

Supply chain management means an integration of all enterprises that work together in order to ensure the end client a product in right time, quality, quantity and at right cost. Introducing of supply chain has resulted in changes in other market participants' perception. Close cooperation with suppliers, clients and others enterprises responsible for logistics is a basic concept. While ideas of common interest and trust were promoted they started to be partners instead of being opponents. The results of investigations conducted in American enterprises identified the factors that determine a success in supply chain management. The most important factors were: reducing response time across the supply chain, increasing trust among its members, improving activity integration across the chain and searching for new ways f this integration, establishing more frequent contact among supply chain members. It is obvious, that those elements concerned simply collaboration and information flow with supply chain members, especially with suppliers. The problems that hinder the supply chain management were also mostly connected with the matters mentioned above. Not so long time ago procurement was regarded as a tactical function that, while well performed, can bring an enterprise only limited benefits. This opinion influenced the way in which supplier were treated. Since that time the point of view was entirely changed as it is shown in Table 2. A necessity of long term relationship with strong both side involvement, two way systematic digital information flow, joint and long term planning, shared benefits and risks is now emphasized. The last section of the paper concerns the subject of relations with suppliers. The most important problem is ""how to choose a supplier?"", so the criteria that are used during the supplier selection are listed. The most common used criteria are: quality, overall cost, delivery time and flexibility; however their importance varied in dependence of product type, kind of enterprise, situation on the market etc. The next question that has arisen is ""how to choose our most important suppliers?"". One uses model for value measurement - it determines supplier importance in relation to the costs of purchase. The second model takes into account supplier importance in relation to the trust. On the grounds of this models the enterprise can point the suppliers that are especially important, determine where the time and the biggest efforts should be engaged etc. In some cases big number of suppliers makes difficult building a relation of partnership. In such situation the optimization of the base of suppliers is necessary. It concerns mostly the first tier suppliers who become the second tier suppliers. It often occurs when the enterprise abandons the production of a component in order to buy it from another enterprise. American research shows that the number of key suppliers increases while the total number of suppliers decreases. Early supplier involvement is a good example of collaboration between an enterprise and its suppliers. It is a mean for improving costs and quality of a new product design. The other way of cooperation is the suppliers' access to production or sale plans or shared using of analysis and forecasts. This advanced collaboration requires a good information exchange.

The 3D printing technology was invented by Charles W. Hull in US, and the first commercial 3D printing equipment was made available in 1988. For the last 26 years it has made a rapid development in many areas such as processing, material, software and related infrastructure, so as to emerge as a key technology that will bring an innovation in conventional manufacturing processes and a great change in future life that we never imagined in the past. The biggest change in the manufacturing industry is to make a mold production of any shape possible, which was impossible in the past without the 3D printing technology, if a 3D digital modeling process of the shape is possible. In addition, the initial level of modeling techniques now available has reached to a level of making a directly usable product, so as to properly make a 1:1 customized production or a small quantity batch production for a variety of products in near future. These phenomena will be reflected as an increase in the number of pro-sumers and individual manufacturing enterprises who make production and consumption at the same time. On top of it, an easy digital data storage and transformation and a long-distance transportation innovation will bring an economic benefit soon by significantly reducing the heavy long-distance shipping and warehousing costs that result from the traditional manufacturing supply chain logistics. The 3D printing technology is also an essential technology to meet the environmentally safe management bases like global lowcarbon green growth and sustainable production movements for the protection of global environment. Currently, approximately 20 kinds of 3D printing methods and systems are in active use, including some exemplary schemes like SLA, SLS, FDM, DLP, POLYJET, etc. along with a variety of materials like metal, plastic, rubber, silicon, wood, ceramic and concrete. Recently, bio-diverse and human 3D printing researches have been on-going to make human body tissue, skin, blood vessels and even organs. Besides, a food printer has also appeared to 3D digitally print foods like chocolate, cookies, pizza, etc. The prevalence of a diffusion-type printer give wings to the rapid popularization of 3D printing technology in many application fields. Those applications of the 3D printing technology are in a very wide range covering electrical and electronic consumer products, automotive, aerospace, medical and dental devices, military equipment, architectural models and education tools. In particular, the present discussion is made specifically in the field of architectural BIM (Building Information Modeling) and its related 3D printing technology on which an active research has been made recently. Additionally, the 3D printing technology is developed from a level of the past architectural modeling production up to that of the current and future architectural buildings where moon rocks are used to make a moon base construction. Therefore, in this paper new possibilities of the 3D printing technology are studied on future architecture and construction fields, manufacturing of plastic and metal subsidiary materials and setting-up of concrete buildings using the concrete printer."

An overview of the surface defects characteristics and their significance has been made. For leather quality estimation the most important features are the size and the location of the defects. These characteristics are measured using image analysis and they are used by fuzzy neural network for determination of the leather quality. INTRODUCTION The surface defects are main factor in the leather quality estimation process. Because of the subjective human-expert assessments and the lack of general criteria there is no universal standard for measure the characteristics of the defects. Most often these characteristics determine three or four quality grades, which are formed on the base of features like the size and the location of the defects on the surface, the correlation between the usable and the unusable areas, the type of the leather, etc. In [6] four quality groups, depending on the proportion of the usable and the total leather area are described. Also the leather product categories are shown, for which the respective quality grade is most appropriate. This manner gives a limited assessment of the sample usability because there is no reading of the location of the defects. Other authors defined three quality groups for cattle hides [5]. They use the size and the location of the defects as measure of the samples' grade. That classification defines clear quality criteria and is suitable for using by the producers of this kind of hides. In the presented project [1] an attempt for definition of quality standard to categorize skins and a global concept for the leather quality estimation has been made. A block-scheme with modules for supply chain analysis, automatic defects detection and virtual digital nesting is shown. Also there are modules for storing the obtained results in database and digital maps and for exchanging the information through the communication channels. However in this project the presence of surface defects is the only quality measure for classification of the leathers, without consideration of their chemical, physical and mechanical characteristics. For replacement of the subjective human-expert assessment in the classification of leather depending on their surface defects, methods for image processing can be applied. In that way this process could be automated. In [2] a method is presented where the leather images are segmented first and then the contours of the defective areas are extracted. The sample quality group is determined by an algorithm for estimation of its usable area. The presented solutions for classification of leather in quality groups use limited number of defects' characteristics and do not give decision for the most rational use of the samples. In this work a method for leather classification by using bigger set of characteristics and fuzzy neural networks is proposed. LEATHER QUALITY DETERMINATION To describe the classification rules it is necessary to analyze the leather model and its areas to be differentiated. On fig.1 the subdivisions of the hide are shown."

Convergence of identification with information using the 128-bit IPv6 structure is possible because it offers 3.4x1038 unique instances to identify events. It is not necessary that all instances must be connected to the internet or routed or transmitted simply because an IP addressing format is suggested. This is a potential alphanumeric framework or the infrastructure of the structure of the platform which may be necessary for (a) identification to improve revenue potential from data routing (P2P packet tracking) for telecommunication industries, (b) use in healthcare and in biomedical sciences, (c) explore the scope of its use in the semantic web by transitioning URIs used in RDF, (d) manage applications involving thousands of mobile ad hoc sensors (MANET) that demand dynamic adaptive autoreconfiguration. This paper offers clues which may be useful to create a digital platform based on a globally accepted standard template (IPv6) to converge syntax and semantics with data, process and context to improve systems interoperability and transparency. The latter, if combined with intelligent tools, such as, application of artificial neural networks and predictive analytical techniques, such as, time-series econometric forecasting tools, may enhance operations management and supply chain logistics by enabling the estimation of risk, measurement of uncertainties and calculation of inefficiencies. These and other dynamic factors as well as outlier events are to be constantly mitigated in order to remain competitive and increase profit in a volatile global economy."

It comprises multidimensional elements including provider, patient and administrative applications. Applications include consumer education and behaviour change, wearable sensors and point-of-care diagnostics, disease and population registries, electronic health records, decision support, provider tools (communication, workflow management, professional education) and healthcare management (human resources, financial monitoring, supply chain logistics). 1 Although mHealth has potential to strengthen health systems worldwide, the evidence base is immature, and consequently, the opportunities to advance knowledge remain limited. 2 3 Mobile devices and apps have become essential tools for disruptive change in many industries, but thus far, this has not happened in healthcare. Here, we discuss five interrelated reasons as to why mHealth has underdelivered and highlight challenges and opportunities for mHealth researchers. THe myTH of THe 'killer app' Disruptors often rely on a 'killer app'-a highly popular application that users will consider indispensable for their needs. At last count, there were nearly 260 000 health apps on the market, 4 but most downloads are never opened and consistent use is extremely rare. Further, these apps are often disease siloed, focus mainly on behaviour change, gloss over privacy issues and are not integrated into any overarching healthcare structure. Such apps struggle to achieve large-scale adoption because of their failure to address the needs of diverse stakeholders. 5 Most apps are consumer facing, whereas healthcare systems tend to be provider facing. This important distinction may explain why the 'killer app' approach is not the correct mindset. The diversity of users and the inability to address their varied problems results in user fickleness and ready abandonment of new technologies. When tools are not connected to systems and human support, they are unlikely to be effective. Consequently, moving beyond a single solution focus towards a 'health ecosystem' approach is needed. 6 NegleCTiNg user perspeCTives aNd prefereNCes Related to the killer app mythology is the tendency to overengineer solutions before having an opportunity to fully understand user needs, contextual factors and the size and specifics of the problem that needs addressing. The Greentree consensus outlines nine principles for digital development, emphasising frequent and in-depth user engagement in all phases of the development process. 7 It stresses the importance of understanding the ecosystem, designing for scale and sustainability , addressing privacy, using open standards and taking a data-driven approach. It also emphasises the need for multidisciplinary collaborations. Although researchers are often the subject matter experts, non-health specialists such as human factors engineers, human computer interaction specialists, anthropologists and ethicists can provide strong methodological frameworks for understanding user perspectives at all stages of the development, implementation, evaluation cycle. 8 By not taking a user-centred approach, we risk overengineering solutions. The most promising use of mHealth to date has not been smartphone apps, but basic functions such as short messaging service or voice calls to address specific issues such as medication adherence and promoting smoking cessation. 9 10 apps are NoT pills Researchers tend to lack a good understanding of how developers operate. Two commonly used industry standards include Waterfall and Agile development. 11 Waterfall is a stepwise process whereby developers iteratively revise their software at each stage of copyright."

[VertigO] La revue électronique en sciences de l'environnement, 17 (3). Article abstract The population of shantytowns of Cotonou aspires to the drinking water from the public distribution network of ""Société Nationale des Eaux du Benin (SONEB)"" at home ; but the necessary resources are often not available to meet it, the collection, transport and storage operations of this water multiply in households. The objective of the article is to underline the risks of contamination of this water along the supply chain. A housing survey was carried out in 190 concessions (2 households per concession) about the conditions of collection, transport and storage of water in shantytowns of the sixth district of Cotonou. The method of direct interview with observations has been done. The results show that 91.6 % of the respondents practice the storage of water of the public network ; 82.6 % use private subscribers or public points of sale (water kiosk). Water is taken to the faucet or to the barrels without coverage. 68.9 % of transport containers are not covered while 89.5 % of storage containers are covered at the level of households. About types of containers used, seals plastic (70.0 %) basins (2.1 %) are more cleaned than the cans (20.5 %) and jars (1.6 %). The storage duration varies from one day to one week. Goblets of consumption are exposed to any external contamination. This various handlings of water constitute as many potential factors of its contamination and waters diseases."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how Woolworths, a South African retail chain, evaluates and controls its sustainable business practices using economic, environmental and social indicators. Design/methodology/approach – A content analysis of Woolworths' comprehensive 2008-2011 sustainability and annual reports examined how this retail chain evaluates and implements its sustainable business practices. Findings – The results indicate that such indicators play a significant role in evaluating and implementing various Woolworths' business practices aimed at sustainability. In addition, Woolworths' comprehensive governance system ensures that its sustainable business practices are implemented and targets achieved. Research limitations/implications – The case study demonstrates that businesses can remain profitable, while at the same time protecting the natural environment and striving for sustainable business practices. Practical implications – This example demonstrates how government influence, institutional mechanisms and senior management commitment to a project ultimately has gone some way to minimise barriers to the adoption of sustainable practices. Originality/value – The example provides not only a seed of knowledge for others in retailing, but also guidance to both practice in general and theory in the field of sustainable business practices. It demonstrates how an organization has taken strategic action, extended this beyond the firm's boundaries and into the supply chain. The case study illustrates how one organization can act as the change agent in the network."

Due to reputation and financial liability concerns, such events are often judicially silenced in litigation settlements. However, the highly publicized cryogenic failure events reported worldwide in early 2018 placed the entire ART community on high alert that liquid nitrogen (LN2) storage tank failures are real. The latter wake-up call has reminded all of us that a strict and comprehensive quality management (QM) plan is warranted (2) to avert serious liability. These QM practices aim to optimize the security and safe freeze preservation of patients' gametes and embryos, while avoiding any risk of specimen losses. Conventional temperature alarm systems have proven potentially insensitive and unreliable, while daily manual level measurements can become a laborious, repetitive quality control (QC) exercise subject to staff deficiencies. Furthermore, we do not have a good system in place to objectively predict pending tank failures. Objective(s): We aimed to exhibit the precision and QC value of routine external weight-based monitoring of LN2 tanks. Material(s) and Method(s): Using an industrial floor weight pad with digital read-out, weekly pre- and post-fill weights of three new VHC-35-11M LN2 dewar tanks (Worthington Industries) and 3 aged (18-19 years old), active 35-36L Taylor-Wharton tanks were assessed (2x36VHC, 1-35HC; made by Worthington). Liquid nitrogen levels were also determined by one individual using dipstick readings. Tanks were evaluated weekly over 3-4 week period. Mean differences in pre- and post-fill measurements of weight (EV) and LN2 levels (EL) were determined, and the correlation between weight and levels changes assessed. Finally, an evaporation rate index (Evap) was calculated for each tank where Evap = EV/L working tank / EV/L control tank. Result(s): The average new 35VHC tank weighed 38.6lbs empty and 103.4lbs full (LN2 level=35 cm full). The average 1 week usage rate (EV/L control) was 3.0lbs/3cm LN2. One active 36VHC (#1) weighed 106.8lbs full (34.5cm LN2) and 97.6lbs (29cm LN2), while 36VHC (#2) weighed 105.3lbs full (34.5cm LN2) and 98.4lbs (27.5cm LN2). Alternatively, the active 35HC tank (#3) weighed 103.4lbs full (34.5cm LN2) and 98.4lbs (27.5cm LN2). The correlation between weight and LN2 level changes in new (control) tanks was 1.0, whereas the Evap Index of the three aged working tanks #1, #2 and #3 was 2.8, 2.5 and 2.4 by weight and 2.3, 2.0 and 2.5 by LN2 level, respectively. Conclusion(s): Weight measurements proved to be a more accurate indicator of LN2 usage/evaporation in dewar storage tanks commonly used in ART labs. Manual dipstick measurements are susceptible to subjective assessment, and in turn were shown to be less precise in determining an Evap Index value. Based on our preliminary validations, we feel comfortable using an Evap Index=2.5 by weight as an objective threshold level warranting dewar tank retirement consideration. Wireless, remote, pressure sensitive roller base systems are being developed to offer continuous weight monitoring, and more precise alarm systems based on evaporation change threshold levels.

Abstract Purpose: This study aims to explore the moderation effect of environment uncertainties (supply, competition, and demand) in the relationship between a firm's drivers (internal and external) and practices (purchasing, design and manufacturing, logistics, and internal management) when going green. Design/methodology/approach: The questionnaire survey was utilized in this study. The survey was distributed to 981 electronic manufacturing companies, with 174 valid responses collected (a response rate of 17.74%). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and regression models were then conducted to test the result. Findings: The result indicates that both the internal and external drivers have significant influence on the adoption of green-related practices when firms going green. It is further confirmed that the practice of green purchasing is significantly influenced by the moderator of environmental uncertainty. Moreover, supply uncertainty has the most significant influence on numerous green practices, such as green purchasing, internal management, and green logistics. Relevance/contribution: This paper measures the drivers, practices, and environmental uncertainty of firms going green from multiple perspectives. It provides guidance to practitioners of how to choose appropriate practices in accordance with the uncertainties they are facing."

As penitentes occur in arid, low-latitude basins where cryospheric water resources are relatively important to local water supply, and atmospheric water vapor is very low, there is potential value in understanding how penitentes might influence the runoff and atmospheric humidity. The complex surface morphology of penitentes makes it difficult to measure the mass loss occurring within them because the (i) spatial distribution of surface lowering within a penitente field is very heterogeneous, and (ii) steep walls and sharp edges of the penitentes limit the line of sight view for surveying from fixed positions and (iii) penitentes themselves limit access for manual measurements. In this study, we solved these measurement problems by using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor to generate small-scale digital surface models (DSMs) of small sample areas of snow and ice penitentes on Tapado Glacier in Chile (30°08'S; 69°55'W) between November 2013 and January 2014. The surfaces produced by the complete processing chain were within the error of standard terrestrial laser scanning techniques. However, in our study insufficient overlap between scanned sections that were mosaicked to cover the studied sites can result in three-dimensional positional errors of up to 0.3 m. Mean surface lowering of the scanned areas was comparable to that derived from point sampling of penitentes at a minimum density of 5 m −1 over a 5 m transverse profile. Over time the penitentes become fewer, wider, deeper and the distribution of slope angles becomes more skewed to steep faces. These morphological changes cannot be captured by the interval sampling by manual point measurements. Roughness was computed on the 3D surfaces by applying previously published geometrical formulae; one for a 3D surface and one for single profiles sampled from the surface. For each method a range of ways of defining the representative height required by these formulae was used, and the calculations were done both with and without using a zero displacement height offset to account for the likelihood of skimming air flow over the closely spaced penitentes. The computed roughness values are in the order of 0.01–0.10 m during the early part of the ablation season increasing to 0.10–0.50 m after the end of December, in line with the roughest values previously published for glacier ice. Both the 3D surface and profile methods of computing roughness are strongly dependent on wind direction. However, the two methods contradict each other in that the maximum roughness computed for the 3D surface coincides with airflow across the penitente lineation while maximum roughness computed for sampled profiles coincides with airflow along the penitente lineation. These findings highlight the importance of determining directional roughness and wind direction for strongly aligned surface features and also suggest more work is required to determine appropriate geometrical roughness formulae for linearized features."

Four approaches on the new occurrence are presented. According to John Howkins theory, the fifteen creative industries (listed by the author) are the core of the creative economy. Both creativ- ity and economy aren’t new, but brand new are its interaction and scope. A wide definition of creativity has formed Richard Florida’s theory of the developing crea- tive class, which is a group of professionals, researchers and artists whose presence creates socioeconomic and cultural dynamism in cities especially. Richard Caves characterizes creative industries on the basis of seven economic properties and presents an idea that creative industries as such aren’t unique but the sectors of creative industries driven by creativity generate new approaches to business proc- esses, the demand-supply chain and covers both economic and social indicators of the country development. Charles Landry has proposed a creative city concept, which states that cities are dependent on one resource only – its people. Creativity changes place, natural resources, market access, and becomes the key to dynamism of city development. A creative city defines a metropolis with variety of cultural activities glued to urban economical and social functioning. Key activities highly influencing rapid growth of the creative industries worldwide are related to both technology and economy. Digital revolutions and economic environments where revolutions took place, changes in technology and communications altogether have formed new conditions for development of creative economy as a new economic phenomenon"

Modern exoskeletons, however, derive more of their popularity from more recent ideas, articulated in the Mobile Infantry powered armoured suits of Robert Heinlein's 'Starship Troopers' novel published in late 1959, or the subsequent Iron Man powered suit imagined by Stan Lee and first published in Marvel Comics in 1963. Both themes have become the subject of very successful recent cinema franchises by Verhoeven and Favreau, in which special effects have been used extensively to create an illusion of reality. The popular appeal of military robotics technology also gained much from the successful, long running Terminator franchise launched in 1984. The original Heinlein and Lee ideas emerged after the Korean War, in which heavy losses in infantry were sustained by Western conscript armies. The prospect of being drafted and sent into conflict was very real for young men of this period, and the idea of a powered armour suit invulnerable to infantry weapons was understandably apt to be popular. The infantry-intensive COIN campaigns of the past decade have reinvigorated interest recently. Fifty years ago robotics technology was in its infancy and a powered exoskeleton or suit was science fiction. In 2011, the basic technology has evolved to the point at which real products are now becoming technically feasible, although with significant limitations compared to sci-fi concepts. But will the future belong to a real Mobile Infantry, clad in servo driven rocket propelled armour suits providing superhuman strength and speed, and bristling with advanced sensors and weapons? CONTEMPORARY EXOSKELETON TECHNOLOGY Numerous technological obstacles need to be crossed before this technology can be deployed spanning the full gamut of control systems, motion and force sensors, actuators, and especially power supplies. Evolution in robotics has brought important advances across many of these areas but the problem of providing a durable high density lightweight power supply remains to be solved. The first genuine attempt at a powered exoskeleton was by General Electric during the 1960s, as part of the Hardiman (Human Augmentation Research and Development Investigation/MANipulator), intended for heavy industrial applications. Immature technology resulted in an expensive failure. The concept did however reappear in science-fiction, implemented as the powered loader exoskeleton in James Cameron's 1986 classic, 'Aliens'. A parallel soldier exoskeleton research effort by Los Alamos National Laboratory, under the US Army sponsored Project Pitman, also failed to produce viable results. A number of promising developmental projects currently active leverage advances in robotic actuator, sensor and control system technology, and exploit Moore's Law driven growth in computing performance per dollar. The ability to precisely control motion and force in complex servo-mechanical systems of this kind requires a lot of fast computation. For comparison, aircraft digital flight controls recompute the aircraft kinematic and control models 50 to 100 times every second."

In order to survive, retailers will have to show they can adapt to changing consumer behaviour and be creative, offering contact-free delivery services and online customer and styling services via social media. Fashion brands that show empathy and support causes to help fight the outbreak will be remembered once the health crisis is over.” What we've seen Primark and Zara have had to temporarily close their stores across Europe. Many of the major fashion retailers including Burberry and Nike were forced to close a large part of their store estate in China during the worst part of the outbreak of the virus. At the time of writing (19 March 2020) the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported over 220,000 people had been tested positive for COVID-19. Increasing store closures Fashion retailers in the UK are facing a collapse in store footfall following the government’s guidance on 16 March 2020 to avoid travel and advising against all non-essential social interaction in a bid to slow the spread of COVID-19. Several retailers have already started closing stores in the UK as more people work from home and abandon town centres. The latest to close their stores are Urban Outfitters, Calvin Klein, Sweaty Betty and Selfridges and soon most other retailers are likely to follow. In an already challenging retail climate, many businesses were already struggling and the COVID-19 outbreak is putting additional pressure on them. Debenhams, which entered into a CVA in May 2019, has been forced to ask landlords for a rent holiday. Several other retailers including H&M and Superdry are in negotiations with landlords about store rental relief and this is likely to become a common story. Primark has warned that store closures across Europe could lead to a loss of £190 million in sales over the coming month. As the outbreak worsens in the UK, Primark may be forced to temporarily close its stores across the country and as it has no transactional online platform it will be unable to mitigate the effect of the contribution lost from these sales. While the government has introduced measures to support retail businesses including a 12–month business rates holiday, this may not be enough to help some retailers such as independents and brands that have already been struggling through this difficult period. Consequently, we are likely to see more casualties over the next year. Consumers are changing their behaviour The latest research from Mintel on the impact of COVID-19 on consumer sentiment, which was conducted in mid-March, just before official guidance by the government to avoid travel and crowded places, showed that 34% of people are worried about the risk of being exposed to coronavirus, rising to 44% of Older Millennials (aged 31-40) and 49% of parents with children aged under-16. When it comes to changes in behaviour as a result of the spread of Covid-19, even prior to official guidance, 22% had already tried to avoid crowded places and 16% to avoid public transport. Following the government’s change in strategy for the delay phase of the outbreak, such behaviours will now grow and it will have an effect on all retailers including fashion retailers. Consumers are becoming more concerned about cleanliness, with 50% washing their hands more often and 29% using hand sanitiser more often. Retailers need to adapt to changes Retailers will need to show they are adapting to changing consumer behaviour. We have already seen supermarkets such as Sainsbury’s and Iceland introducing set shopping times for older people on certain days and there is scope for department stores and other clothing and footwear retailers to do so something similar. However, as more strict measures to control the outbreak come into place in the UK, more temporary store closures will become inevitable and we expect a shift towards more online purchasing of clothing. Retailers will need to find ways to deal with these changes and with growing concerns with cleanliness by offering contact-free delivery services with no hand-to-hand contact. M&S has already announced plans to introduce this. Independent retailers could offer customers a more bespoke online service and may be able to be more flexible at a time when large online deliveries may be disrupted. In China, we saw sales assistants setting up social media WeChat groups with VIP customers for exclusive online fashion shows and there is scope for higher-end fashion stores and luxury brands to offer something similar in the UK via WhatsApp. Nevertheless, as people work from home and go out less, fashion is less likely to be seen as a spending priority. People will be more inclined to focus on essential categories such as groceries and toiletries, as well as on items such as electricals to help them while working from home and on spend on home and garden, where they are spending more of their time. Fashion retailers will need to proactively approach the upcoming months and efficiently manage inventory as sales drop and consumers prioritise essential items. Certain categories such as loungewear and nightwear are likely to benefit as people seek out more comfortable clothing to wear around the house. Supply chain worries diminish Previous concerns about big disruption to supply chains due to the severity of the outbreak in China appear to have been unfounded as most UK retailers’ Chinese manufacturing operations have largely reopened. This means that most retailers will receive their autumn/winter stock in time and the impact is likely to be minimal. However, the luxury fashion industry could still face shortages as Italy is a major source of textiles and leather and many of the well-known designer brands depend on factories to manufacture their products that are based in northern Italy, which has been in lockdown since February. Brands can show they are helping with a good cause There is a growing need for some businesses to shift manufacturing and investment into supporting wider society. We are seeing some fashion businesses responding to these demands. LVMH, the parent company of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, has started producing hand sanitiser to deal with the shortage. It will use its production lines used for perfumes and cosmetics to make large quantities of hydroalcoholic gels to be distributed free of charge to health authorities in France. Dolce & Gabbana has partnered with Humanitas University to fund a coronavirus research project, while Giorgio Armani, Prada and luxury group Kering have all donated money to hospitals and to help the fight against the virus. In the UK, womenswear brand Three Graces London will donate all its net sales between 18 March and 1 April to homeless charity Crisis to help the most vulnerable amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Consumers care how brands act, with research from Mintel’s Designer Fashion – UK – December 2019 report showing that 77% of consumers would think twice about buying from a designer brand that acts in way they disagree with. Mintel Trend On Display highlights how, in the digital world, brands have to become aware that all of their actions are magnified. Brands that show empathy and support consumers during these unprecedented times are likely to be viewed favourably once the COVID-19 outbreak has passed. What it means Fashion retailers will need to show they are adapting to changing consumer behaviour as people become more concerned about cleanliness by introducing contact-free delivery services. Independents and higher-end fashion brands can use social media to offer a bespoke styling and shopping service to their customers. Certain categories such as loungewear and nightwear are likely to benefit as people seek out more comfortable clothing to wear around the house. While fashion businesses are going to be hit hard in the short-term, brands that show empathy and support causes to help fight the outbreak will be favoured over the longer-term."

This paper suggests that in Pakistan among the packaged milk brands there is no relationship between brand awareness and consumer/brand loyalty. In addition, testing relationship by setting perceptions as the mediating variable between brand awareness and consumer/brand loyalty results the same. For practicing managers and marketers it is important to note that there is a need to update their understanding of the nature and role of brand awareness on convenience products which has random switch purchase behavior and low-involvement.

Essentially, to better understand a cyber intrusion, reconnaissance activities should be modeled. Then, strategies of cyber attacker and defender can be studied, which help to identify substations vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In this paper, a successful intrusion is regarded as a probabilistic event related to reconnaissance activities. Its probability can be approximated by the Poisson distribution of the number of vulnerabilities discovered by the attacker. Furthermore, models of intrusion and defense in competition for control of the substations are proposed using Markov decision process (MDP). Key characteristics of target substation, attacker and defender are considered for determining probabilistic state transitions related to intrusion and defense actions. Thus, by solving the MDP models, the optimal strategies (action policies) of both the attacker and defender can be obtained. With these optimal strategies, the cyber security status of a substation can be evaluated within varied time frames. The case study validates the proposed models and method, including time-based strategies of the attacker and defender."

Agility and flexibility are apt to be required for consumer facing businesses to thrive in 2017 and beyond. In the race to deliver customer value, 90-day assessment programs have often given way to an accelerated pace of ""fail fast, learn quickly, move forward,"" and succeed early by delivering minimum viable products. Established players may be at greater risk of losing market share to emerging disruptors who are held to different standards and are better able to exploit organizational and operational agility. The same could be said about customer journey design processes-""fail fast, learn quickly, move forward"" or risk losing customers to more nimble players. NUMBERS REVEAL TANGIBLE RESULTS Hundreds of respondents that used customer analytics and journey design solutions and processes reported the highest return on investment-at more than 5 percent of operational budgets-via these performance enhancements: customer service and support enhancements (31.6 percent); top-line revenue increase (30.5 percent); customer retention (30.6 percent); customer acquisitions (29.6 percent); and customer advocacy, loyalty, or satisfaction enhancements (29.9 percent). These results show there's a strong business case to be made for such investment. Consider that for telecommunications companies, every 18-month contract for smartphone service averages about $110 per month. In every customer service and support interaction, whether online, phone, or email, there is potential to retain or gain approximately $2,000 annually. As noted above, for a telecommunications company with more than 135 million retail subscribers, seemingly small increases in churn or retention can quickly add up. In this age of digital engagement, interaction, and commerce, analyses of customers' interactional and transactional behaviors with the goal of creating actionable business insights are often essential in designing effective omnichannel customer journeys. Business intelligence applications and dashboards may be useful for reporting and providing historical or near-real-time guidance and trends. However, transforming massive amounts of customer information (structured and contextual) into action-able insights is often a significant challenge for organizations of various sizes, across industries and geographies. Leveraging customer analyt-ics and insights to enrich customer journey design has the potential to optimize omni-channel customer interactions and engagement; enhance employee engagement via ""guided intelligence""; improve customers' purchase experience ; segment, profile, predict, and prescribe best practices for optimal types of customer engagement; mitigate identity theft, fraud, and risk; and improve operational business processes through a customer-centric lens. Now is a great time for organizations that want to enhance their customer-centric interactions and business processes via multiple channels and preferred touch points-performance improvements, cost efficiencies, and cloud delivery mean that enabling software and consulting services are more accessible. Conversely, though, it may be a challenging time to select optimal software-based technologies, services, and solutions. There are now more than 500 software tools, applications, systems, and consultancies that offer customer analytics and journey design capabilities and services. Each value proposition is a theme or variation on supporting customer experience management or on improving the customer experience. It can be confusing when these options encompass multiple categories-everything from CRM, voice of the customer, digital marketing, business process management , text analytics, and social media intelligence to workforce optimization, scheduling, and contact center solutions. While some software vendors or providers of consulting services offer solutions that facilitate creation of specific types of algorithmic models, such as customer retention, propensity to purchase, and customer value for retail and telecommunications, businesses should carefully evaluate corporate objectives and goals prior to investing in sophisticated solutions or consulting services."

Businesses, consumers, government regulators, and academic researchers face a variety of questions when analyzing these nascent markets. Will electronic markets have less friction than comparable conventional markets? What factors lead to dispersion in Internet prices? What are the major electronic commerce developments to watch in the coming years? This paper addresses these questions by reviewing current academic research, discussing the implications of this research, and proposing areas for future study. We review evidence that Internet markets are more efficient than conventional markets with respect to price levels, menu costs, and price elasticity. However, several studies find substantial and persistent dispersion in prices on the Internet. This price dispersion may be explained, in part, by heterogeneity in retailer-specific factors such as trust and awareness. In addition, we note that Internet markets are still in an early stage of development and may change dramatically in the coming years with the development of cross-channel sales strategies, infomediaries and shopbots, improved supply chain management, and new information markets."

Abstract Purpose – Use of failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a requirement of ISO/TS 16949. However, research has shown that there are inconsistencies in the way the technique is applied in automotive suppliers. The aim of this study is to identify these irregularities and to propose a strategy to minimize them. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaires were applied in seven of the main suppliers to a European automotive company, and ten FMEAs from each company were analyzed. Findings – The study identifies irregularities in the development of process FMEAs and highlights seven factors that contribute to these inconsistencies. Based on these data, a strategy including a partially preconfigured FMEA form is suggested. When tested with three of the suppliers, the strategy was found to result in a significant improvement. Originality/value – The study describes an application strategy for automotive companies to correct problems associated with the use of FMEAs. The strategy includes a partly parameterized spreadsheet for a cold stamping process that allows companies to implement their process FMEA in a collaborative supply chain environment."

Abstract Purpose – Increasingly, supplier relationship management (SRM) is being viewed as strategic, process-oriented, cross-functional, and value-creating for buyer and seller, and a means of achieving superior financial performance. This paper seeks to describe a macro level cross-functional view of SRM and to provide a structure for managing business-to-business relationships to co-create value and increase shareholder value. Design/methodology/approach – In order to identify the sub-processes of SRM at the strategic and operational levels as well as the activities that comprise each sub-process, focus group sessions were conducted with executives from a range of industries. The focus groups were supplemented with visits to companies identified in the focus groups as having the most advanced SRM practices. Findings – The research resulted in a framework that managers can use to implement a cross-functional, cross-firm, SRM process in business-to-business relationships. Research limitations/implications – The research is based on focus groups with executives in 15 companies representing nine industries and multiple positions in the supply chain, including retailers, distributors, manufacturers and suppliers. While all companies had global operations, only one was based outside of the USA. Nevertheless, the framework has been presented in executive seminars in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia with very positive feedback. Practical implications – The framework can be used by managers and has been successfully implemented in large corporations. The view of SRM presented involves all business functions, which extends the current thinking. Originality/value – The framework includes all business functions and was developed with input from executives representing major corporations with global operations."

Various, highly diverse types of systems rely on embedded computing devices that, com- pared to traditional PCs, are often not directly noticed by the user. Examples for such embedded devices are manifold: RFID-based smartcards are on the way to replacing magnetic-stripe cards for payments and are wide-spread in public transport and user identification. Long-range RFID transponders are used for identifying and managing large assets like freight containers in the supply chain. A modern car comprises a large number of microcontrollers, controlling numerous components ranging from the engine to the immobilizer. Consumer products like mobile phone batteries and inkjet cartridges are equipped with special-purpose chips to prevent counterfeit. Access to online services is secured with hardware tokens for two-factor authentication, and electronic door locks for controlling the physical access to buildings and offices are on their way to replacing traditional mechanical systems. With the increasing reliance on embedded devices arises the need to thoroughly examine the related security mechanisms. Malicious adversaries can cause severe financial losses, e.g., due to IP counterfeit, industrial espionage, or fraudulent payment transactions, but also endanger material and even human lives, e.g., in the case of vehicles, medical devices, or industrial machinery. Hence, many embedded devices incorporate protection mechanisms, often involving cryptographic functionality to fulfill requirements like confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity. To evaluate the security level of according implementations, a purely mathematical point of view is not sufficient: Classical cryptanalysis considers an algorithm as an ideal construct for which only the inputs and outputs are known to an adversary, however, for real-world devices, this assumption does not hold. The actual hardware or software realization of a cryptographic primitive is subject to implementation attacks that utilize physical properties to break analytically secure schemes like AES, 3DES, or RSA. Active fault injection techniques allow to extract secret information by disturbing the cryptographic computation, e.g., exposing the device to over and undervoltages or UV-C and laser light. In contrast, passive side-channel analysis is based on monitoring the behavior of the target device while executing a cryptographic algorithm, e.g., by measuring the power consumption or the EM emanation. Interestingly, the practical threat posed by implementation attacks and particularly side- channel analysis to embedded devices has received relatively little attention in the scientific community. This is in contrast to the in-depth treatment of the theory of such attacks in the scientific community. The goal of this thesis is to fill this gap and evaluate the physical security of widely used devices, with a special focus on side-channel analysis. We propose improved digital and analog pre-processing techniques to increase the quality of side-channel measurements and describe tools to perform implementation attacks at a low cost. Amongst others, we present circuits to isolate the leakage of contactless smartcards and introduce the GIAnT, a cost-efficient FPGA-based platform for controlling target devices and conducting side-channel and fault injection attacks.

However, the two concepts share important concerns particularly as regards content production, content distribution and access to content. This chapter considers the EU’s role in contributing to diverse audiovisual and online content and assesses its limits. Although a signatory of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, the ability of the EU to foster cultural diversity in the digital environment is confined on account of its constrained competences in the field of audiovisual media and online content. Notwithstanding, the EU develops a number of substantive policies that benefit the creation and circulation of cultural content either in an explicit or in an implicit manner. Following a value-chain approach, this chapter discusses the complementary role of various EU sectoral regulations towards this aim. The analysis focuses on the Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) Directive (Directive 2007/65/EC – 2010/13/EU) and various aspects of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications, particularly in relation to non-discriminatory access to bottlenecks in the distribution infrastructure and online platforms. The chapter advances the argument that existing EU policies have an important role to play for ensuring the free circulation of, and access to, cultural content. At the same time, aside from the cultural quotas in the above mentioned AVMS Directive, EU activity is less prominent in the field of content production. The analysis concludes by stressing the complexity of promoting cultural diversity in light of both cultural content supply and demand considerations. It also emphasises the importance of emerging policy issues, in particular net neutrality and findability."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to identify project management issues in a specific construction project in Saudi Arabia, highlighting its unique context. Design/methodology/approach – In the tradition of phenomenological research, a framework based deductive research approach is adopted where a structured questionnaire is used in one-to-one interview with project participants. Findings – This research highlights the interaction outcomes of human, project tool & methods, supply chain and finance affecting overall project execution and goes beyond to identify critical linkages in these interactions, including those that will need identification of skill sets required for the project manager's role, options approach and standardization of product and processes together with early involvement of diverse stakeholders in the project for their better execution through ex ante identification of project parameters requiring minimum changes. Practical implications – The final framework arrived at identifies various tradeoffs involved in project management in the idiosyncratic context of demanding client driving the project needs and internal resistance to change limiting flexibility in project execution. It focuses on deviations from international project execution standards, as found in large construction projects in the Middle East, specifically Saudi Arabia. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of the research lies in arriving at generalizable findings based on the study of a single international hotel construction project, and not an industry-wide questionnaire survey which can, in future, refine and strengthen the framework developed. Originality/value – A study in the context of Saudi Arabia is seldom reported in international journals although large turnkey construction project opportunities exist for international firms in this country and in the Middle East region."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the relative importance of price and trust and their interaction in subcontractor selection. By doing so, it aims to respond to the currently dominant view that trust-based procurement is the remedy to performance problems in construction. The paper also aims to argue that a specific interplay of both price and trust is always inherent to the selection of subcontracted services. Design/methodology/approach – A choice-based conjoint experiment was conducted to underpin the initial argument. The conjoint analysis is based on a sample of medium-sized contractors from the Dutch residential building industry. Findings – The research shows that neither price nor trust can be downplayed as procurement mechanisms. On the one hand, through repeated relationships main contractors become more confident in judging the performance of subcontractors. The level of trust increases and finally affects the supplier selection. On the other hand, favourable quotes are a prerequisite for trust to become choice relevant. Moreover, the extent to which subcontractors have performed with respect to quality, technical know-how and cooperation in the past finally accounts for whether they are chosen or not. Research limitations/implications – The joint occurrence of price and trust as procurement mechanisms should be acknowledged. More research is needed to understand the trade-offs main contractors make between price and trust while procuring subcontracted services. Practical implications – Subcontractors need to offer competitive bids to be able to increase their chance of recurrent relationships with main contractors and thus trust development. Originality/value – This study is one of the first that considers the interaction of price and trust in subcontractor procurement. It contributes to the ongoing discussion around partnering and supply chain integration in construction."

Magnetic field amplitudes of ∼1 pT and vertical electric field amplitudes of ∼0.2 mV have been observed at a receiving site 35 km from the HIPAS site. The wave amplitude does not depend strongly on the ELF frequency, however, the amplitude is closely related to the level of electrojet activity inferred from magnetometer chain data and from ionosonde measurements. The 1‐MW HF heater is modulated at low ELF frequencies using an “array dephasing” technique where the eight‐element antenna array is alternately phased for peak vertical gain and dephased for a spread pattern at the ELF rate. This method can be employed at any modulation frequency without concern for transmitter power supply resonances. Measurements of the wave amplitude are made by conventional analog lock‐in techniques and by continuously digitizing the waveform output of the wideband magnetic search coils and the electric field detector. With the digitized waveform, digital postprocessing can be used to extract the low‐level coherent signal from the Schumann resonance noise background using a software lock‐in routine.

This paper builds on the idea that private sector logistics can and should be applied to improve the performance of disaster logistics but that before embarking on this the private sector needs to understand the core capabilities of humanitarian logistics. With this in mind, the paper walks us through the complexities of managing supply chains in humanitarian settings. It pinpoints the cross learning potential for both the humanitarian and private sectors in emergency relief operations as well as possibilities of getting involved through corporate social responsibility. It also outlines strategies for better preparedness and the need for supply chains to be agile, adaptable and aligned-a core competency of many humanitarian organizations involved in disaster relief and an area which the private sector could draw on to improve their own competitive edge. Finally, the article states the case for closer collaboration between humanitarians, businesses and academics to achieve better and more effective supply chains to respond to the complexities of today's logistics be it the private sector or relieving the lives of those blighted by disaster."

While many view traditional brick and mortar stores as more as a obsolete anchor rather than an advantage still nearly 90 % of retail sales still occur in physical stores. Retailers must use them to their advantage to push back against e-commerce competition. E-commerce is only 2-3% of the country's total retail scene till now. Brick and mortar outlets are trying to hold on to the business that has been theirs alone for years, through lower prices and deals. But, most retailers admit that with all establishment cost, their discounts can never compete with that of online, against which the brick and mortar is searching for a weapon to fight. Omni-channel retailing is an initiative by brick and mortar retailers to better integrate their stores and e-commerce channels by following a collaborative strategy instead of competition leading to their survival and success instead of failing by waging war against an opponent with all the latest weaponry which is the ecommerce. So a retailer can facilitate buying online and pick-up at store; or order online for delivery to home from a store; and several other combinations of fulfilment paths are also possible. Omni-Channel Retailing is a seamless approach to the consumer experience through all available shopping channels, i.e. mobile internet devices, tablets, computers, physical store, television, radio, direct mail, catalog and so on. Retailers are meeting the new customer demands by deploying specialized supply chain strategy software. With the onset of omni-channel as a retailing, marketing can be made is made more efficient more personal with offers tailor made to a specific consumer determined by purchase patterns, social network affinities, website visits, loyalty programs, and other data mining techniques. The study involved literature review, expert interviews and customer surveys that led to new insights of sustainability in retailing ,unearthing opportunities for brick and mortar firms to stop playing catch-up and start integrating channels as now it is now clear that consumer expectations are rapidly evolving, and today’s consumer demands can be better met by an integrated omni-channel experience. The Omni- Channel opportunity makes this one of the most exciting times in history to be in retail for those skilful enough to grasp the opportunity. According to a research report from Research Info Systems (RIS), retailers miss 6.5% of potential revenue because they are not on the omni-channel wagon. What can Omni-Channel retail operation do for retailer of our country by utilizing mobile technology to optimize supply chain operations and streamline customer fulfilment? This paper tries to bring forward strategies align with opportunities and challenges for Omni-Channel to retailers, areas of partnerships through technology and systems integration providers."

Abstract Purpose – The paper seeks to discuss and develop SCM as a scientific discipline using different theories from non-logistics areas to explain inter-organizational phenomena. It also attempts to establish a frame of reference that allows us to mitigate the gap between the current SCM research and practice and the theoretical explanations of how to structure and manage supply chains. Design/methodology/approach – The paper introduces three different perspectives that together will contribute to a broader understanding of SCM in practice: an economic perspective; a socio-economic perspective; and a strategic perspective. The theoretical framework is applied to two important research topics within SCM: third party logistics (TPL); and new product development (NPD). Findings – There is no such thing as "" a unified theory of SCM "" . Depending on the concrete situation, one can choose one theory as the dominant explanatory theory, and then complement it with one or several of the other theoretical perspectives. Research limitations/implications – The way the four theories complement one another is explored on a conceptual basis, but further research into this direction may explore more deeply how these alleged complementarities occur in practice, and how managers mould their decisions by these ideas. Practical implications – The four theories can provide normative support to important management decisions in supply chains, such as outsourcing, safeguards against opportunism, and alignment of incentives. Originality/value – The main contribution is that one cannot rely on one theoretical explanation when analyzing phenomena in SCM. It is neccessary to consider several theories and how they may complement one another in order to provide a more comprehensive view of SCM."

The paper draws from the perceived e-readiness model (PERM) and relies on data collected from a survey of firms in the horticulture sector in Australia. The results indicate that while horticulture firms demonstrate relative organizational preparation for the conduct of e-business, the value network within which they operate does not appear to encourage and support their endeavour. In particular, government and industry associations do not appear to play supportive roles in encouraging the use of e-business among members of the horticulture supply chain. This paper highlights factors that are likely to facilitate or inhibit e-business in agribusiness, an area lacking in research globally. Practitioners such as governments, horticulture associations, growers and growers’ associations, and digital marketplace operators, through understanding the e-readiness factors affecting e-business, can make effective decisions to develop their support, capabilities and offerings respectively."

Based on this analysis, the paper will propose a process model, namely, Lifecycle Exchange of Asset Data (LEAD) to manage asset dataflow between all building stakeholders from design to construction and ultimately to the facility management team. This model aims to help the construction supply chain to produce complete and high-quality asset data that supports the operation phase of the built environment. Design/methodology/approach: A review of relevant studies provided a theoretical background for this study. The authors then collected and analysed COBie data from five live construction projects using building information modelling (BIM) projects from different design and construction companies. The process model is based on an industry placement within Bouygues UK construction company, which was a Tier 1 building contractor in London in the period from December 2016 to December 2018. The researcher used an inductive approach observing current practises in two construction projects to produce “LEAD” model. Then a focus group was conducted with industry experts to discuss and refine the process model. Findings: Analysis of literature and data collected in the course of this study revealed that although COBie is a BIM Level 2 standard in the UK, there is currently a low success rate in producing complete and accurate COBie data in the UK construction industry. This low rate is because of COBie’s rigid data syntax/structure, complexity and ambiguity of its data exchange process, which suggests that COBie may not be the future of the industry. Based on these findings, the study proposed a process model, namely, “LEAD,” to improve COBie output and also to be used with project-specific information requirements. Practical implications: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first to focus solely on asset data exchange process using COBie standard and highlights the problems the industry faces in this remit. The study is based on industry placement for two years, so the analysis is based on actual and current industry problems. Current industry practices also informed the “LEAD” model, and the model provides a step-by-step guidance in producing and exchanging BIM asset data in all stages of the building lifecycle. Originality/value: This paper provides a detailed analysis of the most common problems associated with COBie as an asset data exchange standard. Understanding these problems is of high value for industry practitioners to avoid them in projects. The paper also proposed a novel process model that can be used either to improve COBie quality or can be used with any project-specific data requirements."

He wanted to know if there were any holes that he and his board should address. I’ve always thought this showed great leadership and confidence. (Strategy is a lot like IQ for many people: to challenge their strategy is to question their intelligence.) It also revealed his keen awareness that no strategy is perfect. We started by asking two questions: 1. What distinctive capabilities make the company better than any other at how it adds value to its individual businesses, and how those businesses meet their promises to customers? 2. Are changes happening in the company’s world that could render its distinctive capabilities obsolete or insufficient? The first question requires you to be clear about the capabilities that make your company special. Consider, for example, Frito-Lay’s direct-to-store delivery capability, Inditex’s fast-fashion supply chain, and Toyota’s production system. When company leaders understand their defining capabilities, they can make smarter decisions about what businesses to buy and sell, which markets to enter and exit, what customers to target and value propositions to promise, how to prioritize new product development and costs, where to invest, and all the other choices that are inherent in sustaining a great company. All too often, though, answering the first question reveals a poor definition of the company’s ideal customers, an insufficiently compelling value proposition for a particular target market, or a lack of clear-cut choices about how to enhance the competitive advantage of individual businesses. In one case, for instance, it became clear that a company’s upstream “suppliers” should really be its target customers and that its strategy fell short of having a distinctive value proposition for those customers. Company leaders could not articulate the capabilities they needed to realize a great growth opportunity. This takes us to the second question. The corporate landscape is littered with companies whose strategies became obsolete faster than they were able to reinvent themselves. For example, deregulation killed off icons in the airline business such as Pan Am and TWA. Digital technology overwhelmed Kodak’s formidable business in photography. The emergence of e-commerce obliterated the likes of Borders, Circuit City, and Blockbuster. Smartphones put Nokia’s cell phone business into a death spiral, and sleek, touch-screen smartphones did the same to BlackBerry’s core product. In fact, few companies in any sector can afford to ignore the second question. Consider credit cards, big-box retailing, and the U.S. healthcare system. All the major card companies are seeking to move from traditional payments to digital commerce. In payments, core capabilities are tied to driving card usage because the economic model is based on card transaction fees. But as they move into digital commerce, these companies need a new set of capabilities: the ability to generate, analyze, and use customer data in order to drive sales and loyalty for their primary customer—the merchants that accept their cards. In big-box retailing, most players have run out of room in their home markets for laying down more super stores, so they are seeking growth by using a small-store format to penetrate pockets of geography their bigger stores cannot reach. But the capabilities needed to succeed in these smaller formats, such as merchandising, managing store staff, and operating supply chains, are very different from the capabilities required for large-format retailing. For healthcare providers in the United States, the push for more accountable care will require new business models in which sharing medical risk with private and government insurers increasingly becomes the norm. And, of course, such models will demand a set of capabilities now alien to most of them. There are a handful of leaders who successfully managed the obsolescence of their capabilities, and in the process breathed new life into their companies. Andy Grove famously pivoted Intel from a memory-chip company to a smart -chip company, Lou Gerstner turned IBM from a hardware OEM to an IT services provider, and Phil Knight transformed Nike from a sneaker company to a sports licensing company. Most strategies have sinkholes. Some are obvious; you just need to know what you are looking for. Others develop more slowly, becoming apparent only when it’s too late. The former often come from confusing “strategy” with vision, mission, and purpose statements, or with plans and goals. Companies that suffer from this confusion usually have little to say about that first question above. The latter arise from ignoring the second question until it’s too late. These sinkholes result in strategies that are too static relative to the pace of change in most companies—where the ever-evolving world of customers and competitors threatens to make their capabilities obsolete or insufficient."

Understanding this new way of doing things, in a constant state of evolution, gives us the opportunity to investigate the digital environment in order to take advantage of interactive possibilities. This paper presents the results of an investigation into a new format within the documentary genre that combines visual and literary content, which we have labelled documentarybook. This case study focuses on the documentarybook Hacia una primavera rosa (Towards a pink spring), which was freely distributed through the iBooks Author tool. This documentarybook offers an example, outside the standard conventions of the industry, of a differing supply chain, various reading levels and lenghts, and social public participation with optional levels of involvement. The results of this case study have allowed us to compare the degree of integration between old and new practices and propose theoretical and applied conclusions that may be useful for future social audiovisual projects."

Abstract Purpose – Understanding and defining the characteristics of environmentally conscious or concerned consumers has received attention from academic researchers, commercial sector, and policy makers. The purpose of this paper is to identify distinct market segments in three countries (China, Germany, and Turkey) based on several "" green "" attitude and behavior variables. Design/methodology/approach – A survey was administered in three countries, yielding a total of 1,415 valid survey responses. Findings – Four clusters, ranging from the "" greenest "" to the "" least green "" segment, were identified and characterized for each country. Inter-and intra-country similarities and differences are discussed. Existence of cross-national segments was confirmed. Research limitations/implications – There is a potential gap between actual behavior and reported behavior. Practical implications – The segment profiles can be valuable to firms, particularly to those competing in multinational markets. By delineating areas of similarity among international diversity, enterprises can develop effective global marketing strategies. Social implications – Understanding market segments in this respect is critical for policy makers who try to focus their policies that seek to promote green consumption. Originality/value – This is the first study that uses cross-national data for segmenting the market based on "" green "" criteria, to the authors' knowledge. Methodologically, the paper uses techniques and instruments that have not been used in this context before."

Today product value is therefore created by a large range of partners that organize themselves in complex supply networks. At the same time the relentless drive towards efficiency is reducing time and stock buffers between these partners. This development has made production and logistic processes in supply networks but also within companies vulnerable to unforeseen disturbances. A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-based hybrid control architecture is capable of increasing supply chain transparency by communicating object-related status information to partners. A real-time provisioning of this data then enables dedicated information systems to identify the disturbance and consider its implications for a potential adaption of the production plan. © Carl Hanser Verlag, München."

Abstract Purpose – Consistent with the diffusion of innovation (DOI) model and resource - based view (RBV) theory , the purpose of this paper is to develop a research model for measuring enterprise resource planning (ERP) post - adoption and its consequence on small and medium enterprise (SME) performance . Design / methodology / approach – The model links six determinants based on DOI to explain "" ERP use "" and three on RBV to explain the "" ERP value "" , on which nine hypotheses are postulated . Testing was conducted through structural equation modelling , utilizing data from 558 web - surveyed firms in Portugal and Spain . Findings – Full sample analysis finds that competitive pressure , training , best - practices , compatibility , and efficiency are important antecedents of "" ERP use "" . Together with usage , collaboration and analytics capabilities contribute to "" ERP value "" . Cross - country analysis reveals that complexity is an important inhibitor for "" ERP use "" in Portuguese firms whereas it is a facilitator for Spanish firms .

Introduction As suggested in the literature , innovation is identified more and more as the transformative force that creates and shapes new economies in today ' s digital world . Firms often adopt information systems (IS) to upgrade or improve their business performance and be more competitive (Ho and Tai , 2004) . Davenport (1998) qualified enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems as the most important development in enterprises ' use of information technology (IT) . ERP ' s main purpose is to integrate functions of financial management , supply chain management , and customer relationship management to the greatest extent possible . Such systems manage both information and resources by supporting execution of operational transactions and advanced planning , alongside real - time data access (Klaus et al . , 2000) . As with many other technological innovations , ERP systems were initially implemented mostly in large organizations , and this has probably been the main reason for research to focus on large enterprises .

Abstract Purpose – The article deals with issues such as the size of a purchasing group, the types of benefits aimed for, and the real beneficiaries of purchasing groups. Design/methodology/approach – The observations are based on the literature, as well as on interviews, mostly with Canadian and US health-care managers. Findings – Although often associated with the public sector, purchasing groups are also an alternative considered more and more by managers of the private sector. A purchasing group increases volume consolidation, making it possible to have only one negotiation, in order to increase the purchasing group members' power vis-à -vis that of its suppliers. However, a purchasing group also constitutes an additional link in the supply chain and its objectives could go contrary to those of some of its members. This is why organisations considering joining a purchasing group should analyse this option strategically, in order to assess correctly the potential long-term benefits. Originality/value – This article suggests key questions and an analytical framework to help managers assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of joining a purchase group."

Unlike prior paper fingerprinting techniques that have extracted fingerprints based on the fiber structure of paper, PaperSpeckle uses the texture speckle pattern, a ran-dom bright/dark region formation at the microscopic level when light falls on to the paper, to extract a unique finger-print to identify paper. In PaperSpeckle, we show how to extract a "" repeatable "" texture speckle pattern of a micro-scopic region of a paper using low-cost machinery involving paper, pen and a cheap microscope. Using extensive test-ing on different types of paper, we show that PaperSpeckle can produce a robust repeatable fingerprint even if paper is damaged due to crumpling, printing or scribbling, soaking in water or aging with time."

The terminals branching from a group Ia afferent fibre have different geometrical structures, depending on whether they innervate the nuclear bag or the nuclear chain intrafusal fibres of a muscle spindle. The depolarization of the two different structures as a function of space and time is analysed by digital simulation technique. The studies indicate that the tapered core conductor model of the bag-fibre terminals responds faster than a uniform system similar to the terminals innervating the nuclear chain fibres. The steady state response, on the other hand, appears to supply a more effective depolarization in the case of a uniform system with otherwise equivalent parameters. The results suggest that the bag fibre terminals are best suited for converting dynamical stimuli into an electrical signal, whilst the chain fibre terminals seem to yield a more effective steady state response. The results are discussed in relation to the functional properties of the mammalian muscle spindles and in relation to the earlier proposed models of the mechanical system represented by the two types of intrafusal muscle fibres. © 1970 Springer-Verlag."

Our volume for the Island of Hawaii (2.48 x105 km3) is twice the previous estimate (1.13 x105 km3), due primarily to crustal subsidence, which had not been accounted for in the earlier work. The volcanoes that make up the Hawaii edifice (Mahukona, Kohala, Mauna Kea, Hualalai, Mauna Loa, Kilauea, and Loihi) are generally considered to have formed within the past million years and our revised volume for Hawaii indicates that either magma-supply rates are greater than previously estimated (0.25 km3/yr as opposed to 0.1 km3/yr) or that Hawaii's volcanoes have erupted over a longer period of time (>1 million years). Our results also indicate that magma supply rates have increased dramatically to build the Hawaiian edifices: the average rate of the past 5 million years (0.096 km3/yr) is substantially greater than the overall average of the Hawaiian Ridge (0.018km3/yr) or Emperor Seamounts (0.012 km3/yr) as calculated by Bargar and Jackson, and that rates within the past million years are greater still (0.25 km3/yr).

In the next decade, new business models are possible on the basis of Cyber Physical Systems. Germany could play ""the first violin"" in this case. Being able to assert itself as a production location in a high-wage region, is increasingly becoming a key issue in the global competition. Unlike other industrialized countries, Germany has succeeded in the past ten years, to keep the number of employees largely stable in production. Not least because of the strong medium-sized but highly innovative manufacturing sector, Germany has the economic impact of the financial crisis better than many others. The development and integration of new technologies and processes have significantly contributed. remain the production site is now to get fit for the driven by the Internet 4. Industrial Revolution. - The first industrial revolution, the introduction of mechanical production end of the 18th century, and - The second industrial revolution, the division of labor mass production of goods by means of electrical energy (Fordism, Taylorism) since the turn of the 20th century, resulted from the mid-70s in his continuing - Third Industrial Revolution to the driven through the use of electronics and IT further automation of production processes. In the field of software-intensive embedded systems, Germany has already established a leading position especially in the automotive and mechanical engineering. Now it is time to take the next step to the Internet of things in the industrial environment, so that Germany 2020 is a lead provider in this new market. The digital processing of production and industrial products to everyday products with integrated memory and communication capabilities, wireless sensors, embedded actuators and intelligent software systems created here a bridge between the virtual ( ""cyberspace"") and rem world to the reciprocal fine-grained synchronization between digital model and the physical reality. In developing these cyber-physical systems in Germany already on the results of several successful research projects resorted (Digital Product Memory), whose objective is the exploration and use of technology trends for innovative products and solutions. In this transformation process now to the development of intelligent monitoring and autonomous decision making newly added to control companies and entire supply networks in near real time and optimize occurs in addition to even greater automation in industrial (3rd Industrial Revolution). In the industry, this approach leads to a paradigm shift in which the resultant product will have an active role for the first time: not a central control, but virtually the blank for a product ""says"" how it must be processed in the individual production steps. The resulting product thus controls the production process itself, monitored via the embedded sensor the relevant environmental parameters and triggers disturbances corresponding countermeasures - it is simultaneously an observer and an actor. The vertical networking of embedded systems provides with business application software in addition to completely new business models considerable optimization potentials in logistics and production. The local autonomy active digital product that are installed directly on the scene in the production and logistics chain, resulting shortest response times when faults and optimal use of resources in all phases of the process. The products themselves so get immediate access to the parent process data and can detail exactly ""decide"" - and this while avoiding the information loss that occurs frequently in centrally organized systems because of the (necessary) information condensation. It is thus possible, for example, not only the economic but also the specific environmental requirements to better meet a ""green production"" for a CO2-neutral, energy efficient city. The business potential of the fourth industrial revolution, however, are not only in operational process optimization, but also in their services for a variety of applications. IoT therefore is complemented by the so-called ""Internet of Services"" for Smart Products offer their skills as intelligent services. This new generation of products can independently exchange information over the Internet through machine-to-machine communication (M2M), and trigger actions to control mutually. Only through semantic technology is the interoperability of all services, which are based on the new Cyber-physical systems, ensured even in open loop. To access the active product memories new multimodal interaction paradigms will need to simply as possible to understand for most users the added value of the Internet of Things and Services. The third industrial revolution, which was characterized by new materials, the use of robots and central control systems will be replaced in the next decade with the Internet of Things based Cyber-Physical Systems: Germany should play first fiddle.

Linking the new idea of RFID in P&G's supply chain to the then-red-hot topic of the Internet was more than just a good way to get executive attention. It summed up an important insight—one that 10 years later, after the Internet of Things has become the title of everything from an article in Scientific American to the name of a European Union conference, is still often misunderstood. The fact that I was probably the first person to say ""Internet of Things"" doesn't give me any right to control how others use the phrase. But what I meant, and still mean, is this: Today computers—and, therefore, the Internet—are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1,024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings—by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. Conventional diagrams of the Internet include servers and routers and so on, but they leave out the most numerous and important routers of all: people. The problem is, people have limited time, attention and accuracy—all of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. And that's a big deal. We're physical, and so is our environment. Our economy, society and survival aren't based on ideas or information—they're based on things. You can't eat bits, burn them to stay warm or put them in your gas tank. Ideas and information are important, but things matter much more. Yet today's information technology is so dependent on data originated by people that our computers know more about ideas than things."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop a research model that links Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) adoption issues with established technology adoption stages suggested by Rogers theory of diffusion of innovation (DOI). The research model proposed in this study suggests that RFID adoption in retail industry progresses in different stages. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed methodological perspective is used in this research. Key research issues were identified from a systematic content analysis of trade and academic articles in the first phase. Findings – Data collected from Delphi study is used to test the propositions. It confirms key research issues associated with different adoption stages. Finally, it also confirms that the stages (knowledge, persuasion, design and decision, and implementation) influence RFID adoption decision. Research limitations/implications – The propositions that are developed in the model can be used in future studies for further development. More relevant items should be added to measure each variable. It can also allow future researchers and practitioners to take a more comprehensive approach to look at RFID adoption process as a whole and thus focus on relevant issues across all adoption stages. Practical implications – The research model can provide insights to practitioner to make more informed RFID adoption decisions. Originality/value – Rogers stage model is very important for technology diffusion studies but is not explored much. There is limited research on understanding the overall RFID adoption process. This study is an attempt to bridge that gap and draw attention toward future research in that direction. The research model that is developed links RFID research with existing research in the area of DOI."

The ever-greater developments in the field of artificial intelligence have sparked conversations of its potential in different sectors (society, business, government, etc.). Such is the impact of this technology that the United Arab Emirates has appointed a State Minister for Artificial Intelligence, the EU has created a commission to promote AI and is planning to invest over 1.3 Billion Euros in AI projects, as part of the next EU research program, called Horizon Europe. A growing number of our city's services are entirely based on artificial intelligence and many more are improved by it. From air traffic and food production to the analysis of huge amounts of data which help to create more comfortable and efficient cities. What is clear is that humans are the great architects of this evolution. Machines are dependent on humans, even if they work autonomously. The designed intelligent systems are highly specialized and are created to solve specific problems; they have little capacity to abstract or generate new intelligence far from their sphere of function. Recently Apple won a prize for becoming the first trillion-dollar company in the U.S. However, barring a recession, it won't be long before Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft-each valued at between $800 billion and $900 billion-join the club. Why? Because all four companies-along with other data-rich firms like IBM, Facebook, Salesforce and Chinese giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent-are investing heavily in artificial intelligence. And almost every thoughtful business leader thinks AI will transform the business landscape in the decade to come. Sales and profits will inevitably follow. AI has been here for ages but now we have all we need to make it a reality; computing power, storage capacities, communications technology and man power. With all these resources we can become more efficient by incorporating AI into our daily activities. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin, ether and most of the other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is essentially a form of record keeping and can be used in almost any product that uses some form of record keeping or database management. Blockchain is ideal for protecting any data that must be unalterable and indestructible. Traditionally, data are kept on a server that is owned and operated by a third-party company. This approach is risky since a third party can access, destroy, alter or leak the data. Through Blockchain, data are encrypted and then propagated over a distributed network of computers. In this way, data are nobody's property, data cannot be destroyed nor altered. Data blocks are sets of permanently recorded data e.g. financial transactions. The information is first run through the hashing algorithm which represents the data in a compact format, making it possible to detect changes in the data. Any small change in the data completely modifies the hash version, so it is easy to compare them. Data in a hash format are then encrypted. One private key is used as a digital signature and also allows the producer of the data to perform encryption. Also, one public key allows everyone else with the key to decrypt it. Finally, the data blocks are connected to each other (chained). Bitcoin is just one of the many applications of Blockchain. This technology is an excellent complement to Artificial Intelligence. Blockchain's possibilities are endless in all fields but in industry, it is more commonly used in some areas than in others e.g. Supply Chain Management, Health Care and medical record sharing, Media Distribution, E-commerce with no middlemen, Sharing economy with no central authority, Authenticated News Sharing/Data Sharing, Data Sharing Between companies. Edge Computing streamlines the flow of traffic from IoT devices and provides real-time local data analysis. Instead of a centralized data-processing warehouse, this paradigm processes the data near the edge of the network, where the data is being generated. Edge computing accelerates data-streaming, including real-time data processing without latency. It allows smart applications and devices to respond to data as they are being created, this almost instantaneous response eliminates lag time. This is critical for technologies such as self-driving cars and has equally important benefits for business. Edge computing, therefore, allows for efficient data processing near the source, reducing Internet bandwidth usage, this both eliminates costs and ensures that applications can be used effectively in remote locations. In addition, the ability to process data without ever storing it in a public cloud is another layer of security, useful for sensitive data. AI, blockchain and edge computing are allies and may be used jointly to efficiently develop smart cities and smart grids. Security, reliability, rigorous time response and smart solutions are elements that characterize our modern cities and power distribution networks."

with applications in carbon, water, and ecological footprinting, and Life-Cycle Assessment, as well as trend and key driver analyses. Such applications have recently been at the forefront of global policy debates, such as about assigning responsibility for emissions embodied in internationally traded products. The new time series was constructed using advanced parallelized supercomputing resources, and significantly advances the previous state of art because of four innovations. First, it is available as a continuous 20-year time series of MRIO tables. Second, it distinguishes 187 individual countries comprising more than 15,000 industry sectors, and hence offers unsurpassed detail. Third, it provides information just 1-3 years delayed therefore significantly improving timeliness. Fourth, it presents MRIO elements with accompanying standard deviations in order to allow users to understand the reliability of data. These advances will lead to material improvements in the capability of applications that rely on input-output tables. The timeliness of information means that analyses are more relevant to current policy questions. The continuity of the time series enables the robust identification of key trends and drivers of global environmental change. The high country and sector detail drastically improves the resolution of Life-Cycle Assessments. Finally, the availability of information on uncertainty allows policy-makers to quantitatively judge the level of confidence that can be placed in the results of analyses."

Também pretende-se lançar algumas questões a respeito das finalidades e conseqüências da utilização destes sistemas, que possam ser utilizadas como subsídio para futuras pesquisas. Introdução Durante os anos 90 e neste início de milênio, houve uma grande mudança no papel da Tecnologia da Informação (TI) nas organizações. De um papel restrito ao suporte administrativo, a TI se tornou um elemento incorporado às atividades-fim das empresas, integrando-se aos serviços e produtos das empresas, tornando-se por vezes o próprio negócio (como no caso das lojas virtuais na Internet onde consumidores podem comprar serviços e produtos). Entre os movimentos recentes da área de TI nas empresas está a utilização de sistemas de informação adquiridos de terceiros, tais como os sistemas ERP-Enterprise Resource Planning, SCM-Supply Chain Management e CRM-Customer Relationship Management, e o desenvolvimento de sistemas que permitem análises e a tomada de decisão a partir dos dados gerados nesses sistemas, os DW-Data Warehouses e sistemas de BI-Business Intelligence. Inicialmente serão apresentados conceitos relacionados à utilização de TI pelas empresas e seu histórico, procurando relaciona-la à busca de vantagens competitivas e aos níveis de decisão da organização. A partir desses conceitos, é elaborado e apresentado o modelo da Empresa Digital, proposto neste trabalho. Em seguida, são detalhados os tipos de sistemas de informação disponíveis na atualidade. SI (Sistemas de Informação) e TI (Tecnologia da Informação) Sistemas de Informação (SI) podem ser definidos como um conjunto de elementos ou componentes inter-relacionados que coleta, armazena, processa e distribui dados e informações com a finalidade de dar suporte às atividades de uma organização (planejamento, direção, execução e controle) (Laudon e Laudon, 2001). Já a Tecnologia da Informação (TI) refere-se às tecnologias de computadores e telecomunicações utilizadas nas organizações, incluindo aquelas relacionadas ao processamento e transmissão de dados, voz, gráficos e vídeos (Applegate, McFarlan, e McKenney, 1996). Muito embora estes dois conceitos estejam estreitamente relacionados, e muitas vezes utilizados como sinônimos, eles não são equivalentes. Pode-se dizer que há uma intersecção entre os domínios abrangidos pelos dois conceitos, que se trata da utilização de TI em sistemas de informação. Entretanto, existem ""partes"" de um sistema de informação que não ""são TIs"", tais como os procedimentos envolvidos e meios não informatizados de manipulação e transporte de dados. Da mesma maneira, a TI também inclui tecnologias de conexão (redes), comunicação de dados, voz e imagens não diretamente ligados a usos em sistemas de informação. Neste trabalho, utilizaremos preferencialmente o termo ""TI"", por ser de uso mais corrente, representando toda a utilização de tecnologias de informação em empresas, incluindo-se os sistemas de informação informatizados."

The nature of the value added services of tool manufacturers and commodity suppliers have changed greatly in the past years. From the customer's perspective, tool management services play such an important role in the perceived performance level that no supplier may survive without it. The scope of the service offerings range from the supply of tool components through the supply of tool data for the digital factory to the support of process engineering and the supply of tool layouts. So called ""Toolvending""- machines, by now a standard feature of each service contract, are the visible proof of the increasing awareness for service. But, in a positive sense, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The case study of the close cooperation of Ruhrtaler Gesenkschmiede, a medium sized drop forge operation and ISCAR Germany shows how far the service may go in terms of vertical integration."

The likely problem in the Ad-Hoc networks is how to establish the best routing protocol that assures the requirements of the application concerning about some criteria. This work presents the evaluation of RIP and DSR utilizing the QualNet simulation. Furthermore, the achievement of these routing protocols was assessed based on the throughput, average jitter, average end-to-end delay, and energy consumption metrics.

Abstract Purpose – Considering lean thinking inside and beyond the organisation's boundaries, in the extended supply chain, this paper aims to fill a literature gap clearly stating some outsourcing practices as lean practices and establishing a deployment evolution parallel between both practices. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review was carried out collecting cases of lean deployment in healthcare, from both scientific and grey literature. Cases were classified according to lean deployment taxonomy in healthcare settings, showing some differences in lean journey stages in 15 countries. Findings – There is an alignment between SCM thinking in healthcare and lean thinking that places a SCM decision as outsourcing as a lean practice serving not only strategic intent but solving operational efficiency. There is a match between different outsourcing drivers (transactional, strategic and transformational) and lean maturity levels. The main constraint to deployment of both lean and outsourcing practices are cultural differences. Practical implications – Understanding lean and outsourcing different deployment maturity levels under the national cultural umbrella can open new perspectives to study lean sustainability factors and better outsourcing relationships in healthcare organisations. Originality/value – This paper presents a merger between the state-of-the art of both lean and outsourcing practices in healthcare settings and suggests an outsourcing and lean evolving pathway."

B2C practice and research are analyzed from: (1) consumer, (2) service, and (3) risk perspectives. Three central issues of B2B or supply chain practice and research are next considered: (1) beyond simple efficiencies, (2) innovations in B2B technology, and (3) information visibility. Finally, four overarching research issues are examined: (1) strat- egy, (2) organizational design, (3) metrics, and (4) managing IS. Not all research on the net-enabled organization (NEO) is IS research, and it is critical that IS journals maintain their distinctive focus.

The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxy 1 free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation."

Abstract There are concerns that despite government initiatives to promote adoption of electronic commerce, SMEs still fail to realise e-commerce related benefits. It may therefore, seem premature to discuss electronic marketplaces in the context of SMEs. However, if SMEs ignore e-marketplaces a number of problems can result. E-marketplaces present a significant threat to SMEs since they increase competition and leave non-participants vulnerable to more e-enabled firms. This paper examines the barriers and benefits of e-marketplace participation by SMEs. The nature of e-marketplaces is addressed and the benefits of participation are examined. Drawing on the literature, the barriers facing smaller firms in this environment are discussed. Identification of these barriers, such as lack of standards, supply chain integration and global trading, enables a greater understanding of how SMEs can plan effective strategies to gain from e-marketplace participation."

Abstract Purpose – How manufacturers select distributors who can contribute to distribution efficiency has become an important issue for channel management. While the last decade has seen large shifts in manufacturing and distribution practices, there has been very little empirical research investigating manufacturers' selection of distributors. This study attempts to fill this research gap by proposing and empirically evaluating factors important to manufacturers when selecting distributors. Design/methodology/approach – The study developed a research framework for manufacturers' selection of distributors. Four key constructs were derived from marketing, supply chain, and logistics literature to investigate their influences on distributor selection: firm infrastructure, marketing capabilities, relationship intensity, and logistics capabilities. Four hypotheses were developed and tested with a sample of Taiwanese information technology (IT) manufacturers. Findings – Multi-item scales were developed and validated through standard psychometric procedures. Hypotheses were tested with ordinary least squares regression analysis. The four constructs were found to have positive influences on manufacturers' selection of distributors. Originality/value – The paper represents the first study to propose and empirically test a research model examining factors affecting manufacturers' selection of distributors. Distributors can strengthen their competitive advantage by improving their competence in the four dimensions."

Abstract Purpose – To investigate the relationship between a supplier and firm's level of environmental management activity and the structure of the customer-supplier manufacturing relationship. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents a conceptual framework and looks at the literature in order to investigate this relationship. Three main concepts (supply relationship, lean manufacturing, and environmental management practices) and their relationship to one another are described and the discussion concludes with major hypotheses for further research in this area. Findings – A major literature review reveals that efforts to improve or influence a supplier's environmental management practice raises critical issues of transaction costs and efficacy of approach for the buyer. The review allowed development of a model for approaching issues of supplier environmental performance through lean supply. Originality/value – The environmental performance of suppliers to the supply function can prove to be a costly endeavour if not managed correctly. The framework presented in this paper may be of use in this respect."

When applied together and systemically across multiple missions, these practices can yield tremendous reduction of technical, schedule and cost risks for project development. An example of this synthesis can be found in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL's) Flight Hardware Logistics Program (FHLP), which uses space systems engineering expertise and supply-chain business acumen to achieve breakthroughs in the delivery of space flight hardware. To support the evolution from a few large projects to many smaller projects developed in shorter time, flight hardware delivery must evolve from serial, independent and resource-intensive processes to those characterized by commonality, multi-project support, anticipation, industry-partnering, reuse and easy access to information. These processes are fundamental to the communication, coordination and collaboration that FHLP provides to enhance JPL project success. The heart of FHLP centers on the commonality of flight hardware across multiple projects. As an example, FHLP has demonstrated significant schedule, cost and technical risk reduction using a common buy of 31 flight computers for 9 different projects. Understanding and coordinating similar product requirements for multiple subsystems, instruments, projects and companies can yield even greater savings. Knowledge of upcoming missions, their right product needs, hardware capabilities and supply sources allow anticipatory procurements of flight hardware to reduce or eliminate lead-time. This is being done for flight electronic parts, connectors and fasteners with replenishment funded by compensation from users for supplied hardware. Partnering with industry is achieved with suppliers and users of hardware. Open contracts and supplier early parts buys are examples of supplier agreements while synchronized procurement and inventory exchange are examples of user agreements between JPL and its contractors. Improved tracking, coordination, record keeping and storage of residual flight hardware can provide crucial cost and schedule benefits to future projects. FHLP has developed a low-cost, JPL-wide system and facilities to significantly increase the capability for current project use of residual material from past projects. Having the right hardware information at the engineer's fingertips saves considerable time and reduces the risk of missing important knowledge. FHLP provides limited hardware information today; tomorrow it will provide much more comprehensive one-stop shopping. The FHLP information tools include an on-line JPL-wide hardware catalog of available inventory (with reports, shopping carts and digital pictures), on-line product documentation and database of hardware usage by projects. The many simultaneous smaller projects implemented today do not enjoy the substantial infrastructure and stable expertise more prevalent in the past on fewer large projects. FHLP fills these gaps with services of hardware information, availability, investigation, delivery and storage. Likewise, proposed projects hungry for higher fidelity information, increased heritage and lower costs welcome a menu of support from FHLP that includes information about available hardware, costs, lead-times and suppliers. FHLP's early focus on hardware delivery and inventory will be augmented by enhanced hardware information and expand to include other NASA Centers and industry partners. Breakthroughs will be limited only by imagination, innovation, commitment and energy. © 2002 IEEE."

In Africa, mHealth is a relatively new concept and questions arise regarding reliability of the technology used for health outcomes. This review documents strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of mHealth projects in Africa. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on mHealth projects in Africa, between 2003 and 2013, was carried out using PubMed and OvidSP. Data was synthesized using a SWOT analysis methodology. Results were grouped to assess specific aspects of project implementation in terms of sustainability and mid/long-term results, integration to the health system, management process, scale-up and replication, and legal issues, regulations and standards. Results: Forty-four studies on mHealth projects in Africa were included and classified as: ""patient follow-up and medication adherence"" (n = 19), ""staff training, support and motivation"" (n = 2), ""staff evaluation, monitoring and guidelines compliance"" (n = 4), ""drug supply-chain and stock management"" (n = 2), ""patient education and awareness"" (n = 1), ""disease surveillance and intervention monitoring"" (n = 4), ""data collection/transfer and reporting"" (n = 10) and ""overview of mHealth projects"" (n = 2). In general, mHealth projects demonstrate positive health-related outcomes and their success is based on the accessibility, acceptance and low-cost of the technology, effective adaptation to local contexts, strong stakeholder collaboration, and government involvement. Threats such as dependency on funding, unclear healthcare system responsibilities, unreliable infrastructure and lack of evidence on cost-effectiveness challenge their implementation. mHealth projects can potentially be scaled-up to help tackle problems faced by healthcare systems like poor management of drug stocks, weak surveillance and reporting systems or lack of resources. Conclusions: mHealth in Africa is an innovative approach to delivering health services. In this fast-growing technological field, research opportunities include assessing implications of scaling-up mHealth projects, evaluating cost-effectiveness and impacts on the overall health system."

The comparison has been performed on two classes of circuits, the former with minimum transistor size to minimize power consumption, the latter with optimized transistor dimension to minimize power-delay product. The investigation has been carried oat with properly defined simulation runs on a Cadence environment using a 0.35-μm process, also including the parasitics derived from layout. Performance has been also compared for different supply voltage values. Thus design guide-lines have been derived to select the most suitable topology for the design features required. This paper also proposes a novel figure of merit to realistically compare n-bit adders implemented as a chain of one-bit full adders. The results differ from those previously published both for the more realistic simulations carried out and the more appropriate figure of merit used. They show that, except for short chains of blocks or for cases where minimum power consumption is desired, topologies with only pass transistors or transmission gates are not attractive. In contrast, the most interesting implementations in terms of trade off between power and delay are the traditional CMOS and Mirror topologies. Moreover, the Dual-rail Domino and the CPL allow the best speed performance."

Abstract Purpose – Purchasing has emerged as a key source of competitive advantage. This paper aims to explore how different purchasing strategies are connected to complex supply relationships and to the goal of purchasing. Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on the literature on industrial network theory and industrial buying behaviour. Findings – The contribution describes six types of purchasing strategies that firms exert. These strategies depend on the complexity of supply relationships and the buyer's purchasing goal. Conventional products and services are bought through transactional exchange relationships, whereas strategically important items are purchased through intentional supply networks. Practical implications – Purchasing strategies of a firm emphasise either efficiency or effectiveness of operation. The type of exchange varies according to the nature of supply relationships: it is either transactional or relational. A key implication for managers is that they should recognise the goal of buying, the strategic importance of the object of purchasing, and choose accordingly between the different types of supplier structures. Originality/value – The paper shows that firms' purchasing strategies depend on the nature of their supply relationships and the motive for purchasing. Different strategies emphasise different aspects and events that ultimately manifest themselves in the firms' business models."

Operated by access networks and other operators, they provide benefits to content publishers in the forms of bandwidth cost reduction, response time improvement, and handling of flash crowds. Yet, caching has not been fully embraced by publishers, since its use can interfere with site personalization strategies and/or collection of visitor information for business intelligence purposes. While recent work has focused on technological solutions to these issues, this paper provides the first study of the managerial issues related to the design and provisioning of incentive compatible caching services. Starting with a single class of caching service, we find conditions under which the profit maximizing cache operator should offer the service for free. This occurs when the access networks' bandwidth costs are high and a large fraction of content publishers value personalization and business intelligence. Yet, some publishers will still opt out of the service, i.e., cache-bust, as observed in practice. We next derive the conditions under which the profit-maximizing cache operator should provision two vertically differentiated service classes, namely premium and best-effort. Interestingly, caching service differentiation is different from traditional vertical differentiation models, in that the premium and best effort market segments do not abut. Thus, optimal prices for the two service classes can be set independently, and cannibalization does not occur. It is possible for the cache operator to continue to offer the best-effort service for free while charging for the premium service. Furthermore, consumers are better off because more content is cached and delivered faster to them. Finally, we find that declining bandwidth costs will put negative pressure on cache operator profits, unless consumer adoption of broadband connectivity and the availability of multimedia content provide the necessary increase in traffic volume for the caches."

Abstract Purpose – The aim of this paper is to present a purchasing portfolio model for determining purchasing strategy at the component level of a product to support business strategy, addressing weaknesses in the often cited Kraljic-type models. The work draws on Fisher's model to match supply strategy to product nature. However, Fisher's model was criticised very recently by Lo and Power in this journal because it is unclear how the "" leagile "" option should fit into it. This paper addresses this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The new portfolio model is based on the literature, particularly Fisher's seminal work. It is then applied to two case studies; an electric boiler manufacturer and an elevator manufacturer, both in South Korea. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to position purchased components in the model. Findings – Different purchasing strategies should be assigned to different components according to their impact on the competitive priorities. As the electric boiler is a functional product, while the elevator is an innovative product, the case studies show how this can vary across the two product-types identified by Fisher. Research limitations/implications – The new model has been tested on only two case studies, which limits the ability to generalise the findings. Future work will use the lean and agile purchasing portfolio model in research and knowledge exchange activities with other industrial partners to further develop and test its efficacy. Originality/value – The new model captures the finding of Fisher and others that products should be classified as functional or innovation to determine their suitability for lean or agile supply respectively. However, this classification is extended here to the component level and with the addition of the leagile and non-strategic supply options, and it depends on the impact a component has on the four competitive priorities; cost, quality, time and flexibility."

The Internet embodies the importance of technology, its role in resolving disputes, and its impact on the increasing globalization of business, information, and culture. XBRL means Extensible Business Reporting Language. It is an open specification which uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) based data tags to describe financial statements for both public and private companies. It uses accepted financial reporting standards and practices to exchange financial statements across all software and technologies, including the Internet. It is a twenty-first century digital business reporting language which allows software vendors, programmers, intermediaries in the information preparation and distribution process and end users who adopt it as a specification to enhance the creation, exchange, and comparison of business reporting information. This paper, using the secondary data methodology approach suitable for large expository research, presents the advent of the XBRL technology and framework, its history and why it is essential. It reveals the relationship between XBRL and emerging e-standards, highlights the XBRL as a vital support for e-business, and showcases the largest XBRL e-government project in the world. This research finds that XBRL streamlines the financial information supply chain that includes public and private companies, the accounting profession, data aggregators, the investment community and all other users of financial statements. Findings also show that XBRL offers several key benefits like technology independence, full interoperability, efficient preparation of financial statements and reliable extraction of financial information. This work recommends that organizations/investors in every industry, regulatory bodies, professional associations, government, and educational institutions must embrace the XBRL in order not to suffer obsolescence and uncompetitiveness.

In the proposed scheme, leakage power is controlled by dynamically disconnecting supply to inactive blocks and adjusting body bias to further limit leakage and to maintain performance. Leakage power measurements at 1.8V, 75C demonstrate power reduction by 59.4% in case of 1bit full adder and by 43.0% in case of a chain of four inverters using SVL circuit as a power switch. Furthermore, we achieve leakage power reduction by 94.7% in case of 1bit full adder and by 91.8% in case of a chain of four inverters using dynamic body bias. The forward body bias of 0.45V applied in active mode improves the maximum operating frequency by 16% in case of 1bit full adder and 5.55% in case of a chain of inverters. Analysis shows that additional benefits of using the DSVL and body bias include high performance, low leakage power consumption in sleep mode, single threshold implementation and state retention even in standby mode. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

Despite India’s good economic performance, it is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the Global Hunger Index (2013), India ranks 63rd out of 88 countries. In Madhya Pradesh alone (a state in India) more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. Needless to say, steps need to be taken at war-footing to improve agricultural productivity. With fiscal deficits already high, public investments in agriculture are not expected to pick up. In this context, private initiatives in Indian agriculture that promote productivity and embed sustainability in their business model remain important. The basic objective of the paper is to focus on an illustrative case study of setting up of internet kiosks referred to as ‘e-Choupals’. This case study empirically substantiates what economic literature has always been emphasizing, i.e. information is critical for the efficient functioning of markets (Stigler 1961; Salop and Stiglitz 1977). ‘e-Choupal’ is an innovative market-led ICT project by an Indian private sector company (ITC), which provides access to information primarily to farmers. Since e-Choupals have figured prominently in the context of transformation of agricultural systems in India, we have analyzed it as a case study. Thereafter, based on existing research the paper reviews the impact of this intervention on outcomes such as: the price of soybean received by the farmers; their subsequent plantation decisions as captured by acreage under cultivation; income of farmers; and benefits to ITC. Leveraging the power of Information, Digital Technology and the Internet ‘e-Choupal’ empowers small and marginal farmers with services related to know-how, best practices, timely and relevant weather information, and transparent discovery of prices (Anupindi and Kumar, 2006; Goyal 2010, Kumar, 2004; Meera etal., 2004; Upton, 2003; Yogisha etal, 2008). The paper discusses how the system eliminates most intermediaries and develops a virtual integration of the supply chain, thereby triggering a virtuous cycle of higher productivity, higher incomes, enlarged capacity for farmer risk management, and larger investments to enable higher quality and productivity. We believe that analyzing the role of e-Choupal as an illustrative case study is amenable to extension to other developing countries where agriculture and food security remain a cause of concern."

A new paradigm has emerged whereby companies are utilizing skilled engineering teams dis-persed around the world to develop products in a collaborative manner. Best practice in product development (PD) is now rapidly migrating from local, cross-functional collaboration to a mode of global collaboration. Global product develop-ment (GPD) therefore represents a major transformation for business, and it applies to a broad range of industries. The objective of this article is to present frameworks that can help companies address various strategic and tactical issues when considering adoption of GPD. The concepts have been developed mainly through detailed discussions with managers at more than 100 companies in 15 countries in North America, Europe and Asia. Some data are from a recently completed study on GPD that product development company PTC has con-ducted with BusinessWeek Research Services, interviewing and surveying more than 1,100 engineering managers worldwide. (See "" About the Research, "" p. 24.) In our discussions with managers, many have found the ideas, frameworks and per-spectives presented in this article to be helpful in addressing the transformation to global product development and its implementation today. There is no blueprint, but senior managers can more effectively plan for global product development and take fuller advantage of its promise by examining the various strategies, staged approaches and key success factors described herein and adapting those insights to their own unique set of circumstances. Defining Global Product Development Several best practices in product development evolved through the 1980s and 1990s. By 2000, it had become widely accepted that highly effective product development included co-location of cross-functional teams to facilitate close collaboration among engineering, marketing, manufacturing and supply-chain functions. Co-located PD teams could concurrently execute the range of activities involved, from understanding market and customer needs, through conceptual and detailed design, testing, analysis, prototyping, manufacturing engineering and postsales technical product support/engi-neering. This concurrent engineering practice resulted in better product designs, faster time to market and lower-cost production. PD activities were generally located in cor-porate research and development centers, which maintained linkages to manufacturing sites and sales offices around the world. By contrast, the emerging best practice in PD today utilizes a highly distributed, net-worked development process facilitated by a fully digital PD system. Global product"

can have a major impact on the success of the development of these firms' capabilities and resources. However, there is insufficient conceptualisation of this phenomenon in the international business literature, which has either presented a list of determinants of the occurrence of inter-firm linkages without identifying underlying constructs, focused on aggregate impacts of specific types of linkages or explored individual firm case histories. Such approaches inhibit our understanding of linkages at the firm-level generally and how they impact both local and foreign participants, in particular. Drawing on insights from other disciplines, a framework for analysis and future research is developed in this paper. This framework identifies three underlying constructs that determine the efficacy of linkages. It is argued that potential for firm capability and resource development via foreign-local interaction depends on the scope, quantity and quality of linkages formed. This approach reinforces the notion that particular dimensions of linkages, such as type, depth or duration, cannot be considered in isolation. Further, the paper argues that the relative emphasis on linkage scope, quantity and quality will involve trade-offs between them and maintaining equilibrium between global and local considerations.

Therefore, researchers have considered subthreshold logic as a promising option to achieve ultra low energy dissipation. However, circuit propagation delay is extremely sensitive to PVT variations under subthreshold operation. Hence, large delay margin is required for successful operation of conventional synchronous designs. Since leakage energy contributes to a substantial portion of total energy dissipation in subthreshold operation, the leakage energy dissipated for the required delay margin degrades energy efficiency significantly. In addition, even small intra-die variations result in large clock skew and hence, it is difficult to efficiently handle timing issues such as the setup and the hold time violations. In this work, we explore asynchronous design approach to address these challenges in subthreshold operation. We employ critical-path replica to generate completion signals of combinational logic blocks and use classical four-phase handshaking for communication between pipeline flip-flops. Since the proposed design approach uses only local clock buffers, it is easier to handle timing problems compared to synchronous designs. We compared iso-yield minimum energy dissipation of two design approaches (synchronous and asynchronous) in an inverter chain. Despite leakage overhead due to pad delay of critical-path delay line and ""return-to-zero"" time of four-phase handshaking, the proposed asynchronous design shows 71% energy savings compared to its synchronous counterpart. To demonstrate subthreshold operation of the proposed design approach, we fabricated an 8-tap FIR filter in 90 nm CMOS. Measured oscilloscope plots of handshaking and output bus signals show that the design operates successfully below 300 mV. We also measured energy consumption of the FIR filter from 19 test chips-the average was 4.64 pJ and the standard deviation was 0.3526 pJ. © 2006 IEEE."

Abstract Purpose – Quality certification to international standards is an obligatory requirement for automotive and truck industry suppliers of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The unique aspect of companies that had their foundation in research and development (R&D) and evolve to operations is that they require a different approach to implement and certify their quality management system. This paper aims to investigate this issue. Design/methodology/approach – The strategy was to plan an effective implementation of a quality system through the continual application of internal audits and supplier readiness reviews. The evaluation processes for departments and stakeholders had been in place since the first "" Gap "" audit when assessing the level of compliance against the international standard and the customer requirements. Findings – Seven aspects were part of the readiness reviews (Engineering, Operations, Supply Chain, Quality Assurance, Material Control, Supplier Control, and APQP). Each aspect was assessed independently up to its complete implementation. The level of engagement of the implementation team and the commitment of the top management were increased with each audit result. Practical implications – Creation and improvement of policies, procedures and forms were part of the strategy to ensure that the internal audit process remains objective de rigueur to assess the effective implementation of the system. Check-lists and recurrent internal audits were performed on the brand-new operations activities of the company. Originality/value – The introduction of the known maturity level of processes is a method of factorizing and setting priorities for the implementation."

We develop a model of consumer learning and choice behavior in response to uncertain service in the marketplace. Learning could be asymmetric, that is, consumers may associate different weights with positive and negative experiences. Under this consumer model, we characterize the steady-state distribution of demand for retailers given that each retailer holds a constant in-stock service level. We then consider a noncooperative game in steady state between two retailers competing on the basis of their service levels. The demand distributions of retailers in this game are modeled using a multiplicative aggregate market-share model in which the mean demands are obtained from the steady-state results for individual purchases, but the model is simplified in other respects for tractability. Our model yields a unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We show that asymmetry in consumer learning has a significant impact on the optimal service levels, market shares, and profits of the retailers. When retailers have different costs, it also determines the extent of competitive advantage enjoyed by the lower-cost retailer."

Abstract Purpose – This study aims to investigate sustainable procurement in the UK public sector. Design/methodology/approach – Sustainable procurement is investigated using a questionnaire that draws on established scales for "" purchasing social responsibility "" . The survey was administered across the UK public sector, and 106 responses were received from procurement officers. Findings – Analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey data reveal there is significant variation across public sector agencies in the nature of sustainable procurement practice. Local authorities have a particularly strong emphasis on buying from local and small suppliers relative to other sectors, health looks generally lower in many categories, and education appears to have something of an emphasis on environmental aspects of sustainable procurement. Cost has been found to be the leading barrier to sustainable procurement, and top management support the leading facilitator. Research limitations/implications – There is likely to be selection bias in the sample, with those practitioners engaging in the sustainability agenda being more likely to have responded to the questionnaire. The United Kingdom government has an objective amongst the leaders in Europe on sustainable procurement by 2009, and early signs are encouraging that progress towards this goal is underway. Originality/value – This paper provides the first survey of sustainable procurement practices across the UK public sector. It also provides a conceptual framework of influences upon the propensity to engage in sustainable procurement practice."

Abstract Purpose – This study aims to enhance understanding of using Web 2.0 technologies and social media in a global corporation. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case study in a global corporation was conducted to illustrate the main uses of social media and to describe the related service portfolio. Findings – The main uses of social media were identified and conceptualized based on the case company data. Internally, social media was used to for internal communication and knowledge transfer, to reach personnel and to conduct internal idea crowdsourcing. Externally, social media was used to enhance communications related to the company brand, to enable dialogue with customers, to build communities with various stakeholder groups and to engage external stakeholders in idea generation via a crowdsourcing platform. A categorization of social media uses for communication, collaboration and connecting vis-à -vis external and internal uses was created. Idea creation practices were further conceptualized as the main enactment of Web 2.0 social media technology. Research limitations/implications – This study is a single case study and thus the results cannot be generalized. Practical implications – As Web 2.0 technologies and social media have become a topic of interest for many companies, it is essential to understand how social media can be used in a business context. The classification of social media uses is deployed to highlight the possible implications for company operations, and the human factor is emphasized in system adoption and use. Challenges related to social media implementation are described. Originality/value – As of to date, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence on uses of social media. This research is based on a case study, allowing an in-depth insight into the phenomenon and related issues. 1. Introduction There are two on-going developments that are causing major transformations in economic and social activity. First, the ubiquity and reach of electronic networks continue to grow exponentially, and second, networks enabled by digital platforms and technologies are increasingly creating value for both individuals and organizations (Agarwal et al., 2008). Advances in technology such as item identification, mobile data services and Web 2.0, including wikis, blogs and collaborative platforms, provide opportunities for companies to improve their internal operations and collaborate with their supply chain partners (Agarwal et al., 2008; Culnan, 2010). Web 2.0 can be regarded as an umbrella term, encompassing new collaborative technologies (Morrison, 2009) whereas social media can be described as a result of applying Web 2.0 technologies in online social environment (Bonsón and Flores, 2011). For example, companies can make use of virtual idea laboratories and interactive open source communities in sourcing ideas and innovations by engaging customers, suppliers and other trading partners"

The program ""SMS for Life"" used Short Messaging Service (SMS) to monitor antimalarial stock levels at public health facilities and address the stock-out problem in Tanzania. After a successful pilot in 2010, the proportion of health facilities that had no stock of one or more antimalarials declined from 78% during the first week of the program to 26% at week 21. The nation-wide scale up was implemented across all 5600 public health facilities. However, a study in 2013 showed that Tanzania continued to experience antimalarial stockouts. The program was discontinued without replacement in 2016. This case study documents the evolution of the program from a health systems integration perspective to draw lessons for mHealth approaches to supply chain management at scale. We reviewed internal and external documentation on ""SMS for Life"". Using purposive and snowball sampling methods, semi-structured interviews were conducted among identified relevant stakeholders at international, national, district and health facility levels. Data from semi-structured interviews and document review were triangulated and analyzed. Additionally, a social network analysis was done to describe the relationship among the actors involved in the program. We analyzed the implementation of the program in terms of system thinking against health system building blocks framework and the WHO MAP framework. The results provide details on the roles of stakeholders, as well as, the variables and evidence considered in the decision-making processes. We also identified factors that led to the termination of the program in Tanzania. ""SMS for Life"" was viewed to have performed well on a technical level, but insufficient ownership and system integration were identified as major barriers to sustainability at scale. A new version of ""SMS for Life"" is currently being planned and the identification of the bottlenecks in Tanzania will inform planning to ensure integration and long-term results. Findings of this study will also help overcome similar barriers in other mHealth programs."

Thus, while the construction industries of the developed economies use PMS for a wider range of project management processes, the SEE construction industry still practices management mainly through financial procedures and material planning. Therefore, the PMS originating from developed countries, in the present form, is of little use in transitional economies.

Abstract Purpose – The devastating impact of catastrophic disasters on terrestrial infrastructure requires the adoption of alternative technology solutions among humanitarian organizations. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role of the most commonly used satellite technologies in relief logistics: imagery and mapping, portable global positioning system (GPS) positioning devices, telecommunications, and GPS vehicle tracking. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines both the benefits and limitations of satellite technologies in light of the existing literature and through a complementary questionnaire survey with field workers involved in humanitarian operations in the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Findings – The results show that the use of satellite technologies can facilitate most of the key logistics challenges encountered by relief actors. However, they also highlight important barriers within humanitarian organizations such as the lack of skilled workers and high costs, underlining the need for long-term training, resource investments, and cooperation between users and technology providers. Research limitations/implications – The research findings remain valid only in the context of catastrophic disaster responses, which lead to similar destructions, logistical problems, and needs for satellite technologies. Practical implications – This paper shows how satellite technologies can support humanitarian professionals in the field. It also provides policy recommendations that can facilitate the use of these technologies. Originality/value – The applications of satellite technologies within humanitarian supply chains are not well-defined in the literature. This paper is the first to be dedicated to analyze the role of the main satellite technologies used in a relief logistics setting. 1. Introduction The flexible and timely deployment of relief organizations is crucial for saving lives in the immediate aftermath of a sudden-onset catastrophic disaster (Holguín-Veras et al., 2012). In particular, logistics is the most essential function for providing vital aid, such as water and food supplies (Howden, 2009). However, the physical destruction and chaotic settings induced by large-scale disasters limit assessment and response capacities, and increase coordination difficulties (Holguín-Veras et al., 2012; Howden, 2009; Van Wassenhove and Pedraza Martinez, 2012). Therefore, acquiring accurate information regarding the ground situation is crucial to evaluate the disaster's impacts and manage emergency operations. To this end, relief organizations can use information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to reduce environmental uncertainty (Fuhrmann et al., 2008; Koudelka and Schrotter, 2007; Varvas and McKenna, 2013), and improve coordination and aid delivery (Conti, 2008; Varvas and McKenna, 2013). Thus, technology utilization is a critical success factor in a humanitarian context for information retrieval, performance, and process streamlining (Buddas, 2014). According to the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC, 2013), several technologies can be used in response actions such as mobile data collection, satellite imagery, aerial photography, drones, crowdsourcing information, social media, SMS-based feedback from affected people receiving aid, and telecommunication channels. Social medias, such as"

Vibrations are probably directly responsible for the disease, while among the other favorizing factors the different winter climatic conditions do not appear to be relevant, and this is the case with conventional vascular risk factors, apart perhaps for hypertension. A history of injury to hands is significantly more frequent in affected subjects possibly related to a relative digital cutaneous hypo-esthesia. Capillaroscopy shows organic microangiopathies with reduction in number of nail-bed capillaries and functional angiopathies of arteries of hand in the form of abnormal spasm induced by cold. Technical progress by the use of chain saws has markedly reduced incidence of this occupational disease, but in France it would appear that only modifications in working conditions of lumberjacks could reduce the incidence of the disease."

Abstract Purpose – Supplier development (SD) is a kind of collaboration among a buyer and a supplier to seek constant improvement in supplier performance and capabilities to provide better quality, on-time delivery of products and services at lower cost. The purpose of this paper is to exhibit and summarize the important aspects of SD benefits, SD criteria and SD activities. Design/methodology/approach – The review of SD aspects is based on 72 papers published from 1991 to till date in academic databases namely Science Direct, Emerald, Springer-Link Journals and IEEE Xplore with "" supplier development "" and "" vendor development "" as keywords. Findings – Through the literature review, this paper brings up the analysis of aforementioned aspect of SD in detail and put forth 43 SD benefits, 23 SD criteria and 9 SD activities. This paper also presents the important SD benefits, SD criteria and SD activities based on the occurrence in literature. Research limitations/implications – The literature on practical difficulties for implementation of SD activities, and trade-off between benefits and risk associated with SD activities are seldom available. Originality/value – This paper presents a literature review on three crucial aspects namely SD benefits, SD criteria and SD activities. The SD benefits, SD criteria and SD activities are identified according to their level of importance. The main contribution of this paper is to draw together three above mentioned important aspects of SD. 1. Introduction Supply chain management (SCM) is increasingly viewed as a source of competitive advantages as the manufacturing organizations continue to concentrate on core competencies and outsource non-core products and services to external suppliers. Supplier improvement is closely related to supplier development (SD) activity. SD activity requires the investments by buyers and suppliers for producing good-quality outputs (Praxmarer-Carus et al., 2013). It also leads to improvements in their marketing process (Asare et al., 2013). However, suppliers' performance must be controlled and developed to meet the needs of the buying organization (Krause et al., 1998). SD can be defined as any effort by a buying organization to increase the performance and capabilities of the supplier, which leads to produce positive results for the buying organization (Batson, 2008; Abdullah and Maharjan, 2003; Krause et al., 2000). The purchasing researches mainly focused on SD programmes and explore how SD initiatives have an impact on buyer and supplier performance (Li et al., 2012). It is widely accepted that in order to compete and survive, organizations must seek, build up and maintain relationships with capable suppliers and extract the maximum value through the SD activities (Dyer, 1996). The buying organizations are relying on their suppliers for quality products, on-time delivery and better services in a cost effective way."

The syndrome was usually mild, but the patients had an abnormally high incidence of accidents at work, including wounds and cut off fingers. The number of capillary loops was significantly reduced. The lumberers affected showed an abnormal spasm of the digital artery in response to cold; the predictive value of this test was 88%.

Group 1: Traditional Design and Manufacture Process: The geometry of the orthotic is determined by an impression box taken in clinic. The clinician will generate a descriptive prescription for the foot orthotic, including the position of any additions and a description of the materials to be used for each component. The impression box and prescription will be posted or collected to the manufacturer for production. A plaster cast of the foot is then produced. EVA material will be heat formed to the cast and additions will be added manually to match the prescription. This will then be posted back to the clinic for fitting. EVA shells will primarily be made of Low to Medium Density (20 ‐40 Shore A) hardness with additional features including; varied hardness forefoot sections, cut outs, cut and fills and metatarsal bars material density used in additions will vary dependent on individual requirements. Top covers may be used where multiple additions are included. Group 2: EVA Milled: The upper surface will be based on unmodified shape of the plantar surface of the foot, captured using a digital scan of the patient’s foot. The scan will be taken with the foot plantargrade and participant sat with both legs straight (tibia aligned) and a normal (for that participant) distance apart. The geometry of the other three orthotic surfaces will be as per a template orthotic within the iCustom design tools. The clinician will adapt the digital orthotic design to allow positioning of additions. The description of materials to be used will be recorded in the participant design notes. Digital designs will be sent electronically to UoS for production. The orthotic will be made using milling processes from a block of EVA in the range Shore A 20‐40 and additions or top covers will be applied manually. Participants attend clinical reviews at 5 months and 8 months after enrollment. CONDITION: Diabetes ; Nutritional, Metabolic, Endocrine ; Diabetic Foot PRIMARY OUTCOME: Plantar pressure will be measured using an in shoe plantar pressure system which captures data concerning the distribution of weight across the bottom of the foot whilst wearing the orthotic insoles at baseline, 1, 2, 5 and 8 months. SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Patient outcomes measured using validated questionnaires (EQ5D, ICECAP, FHSQ) at months 0, 1, 2, 5 and 8.; 2. Compliance measured via telephone check‐ups at months 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 ; 3.

Digitalization with its potential to be automated was the large mainspring in all developments. Digital prepress noticeably displaces analog processes and digital printing has experienced a breakthrough in all technologies. For over 20 years the word ""digital"" implied ""futuristic"" throughout the copying world after Crosfield company introduced the Magnascan 550 to the market as the first digital drum scanner. While at that time digital controllability made progress, in many cases there was a lack of reliability in the young digital technology. Today, digital engineering stands for technical reliability and the highest degree of automation. From the imposition of illustrations with the digital camera and scanner to setting up pages, the competition leads to the plate or printing machine as a quicker and more secure way that can be interrupted only by inspection at the monitor or by proofing on paper. The quality depends on the individual members of the chain and on the automated production path, the workflow. The discussion covers the new developments in 2000 in digital photography; color separation scanner; workflow management; the digital proof system; film exposure; computer-to-plate (CtP): thermal versus UV radiation; changes in the supply industry; the problem involved in the construction of an economical four page disk typesetter; very large format (VLF) disk typesetter at drupa 2000; the thermoplate as still a hot potato; electrophotographic black and white laser printing; electrophotographic color printing; direct imaging offset; and interesting developments in other printing processes.

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to theory development in SCM by investigating the potential impacts of Big Data Analytics on information usage in a corporate and supply chain context. As it is imperative for companies in the supply chain to have access to up-to-date, accurate, and meaningful information, the exploratory research will provide insights into the opportunities and challenges emerging from the adoption of Big Data Analytics in SCM. Design/methodology/approach: Although Big Data Analytics is gaining increasing attention in management, empirical research on the topic is still scarce. Due to the limited availability of comparable material at the intersection of Big Data Analytics and SCM, the authors apply the Delphi research technique. Findings: Portraying the emerging transition trend from a digital business environment, the presented Delphi study findings contribute to extant knowledge by identifying 43 opportunities and challenges linked to the emergence of Big Data Analytics from a corporate and supply chain perspective. Research limitations/implications: These constructs equip the research community with a first collection of aspects, which could provide the basis to tailor further research at the nexus of Big Data Analytics and SCM. Originality/value: The research adds to the existing knowledge base as no empirical research has been presented so far specifically assessing opportunities and challenges on corporate and supply chain level with a special focus on the implications imposed through Big Data Analytics."

This paper proposes and applies a mathematical model for evaluating the impacts of digital platforms, with a focus on solutions to mitigate risks in sea transport operations. The model is based on scenarios and decision tree models to evaluate the impacts of a supply chain digital ecosystem on full containers shipped from Asia to Europe implemented by four companies.

Current burdens are the missing willingness to exchange far-reaching information even with long-term partners and the missing technological interface standards in order to enable a trouble-free communication alongside the SC. Second, the impact of Industry 4.0 and the Digital Transformation on decision making is greatly connected to information sharing.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the movement toward smart manufacturing-defined by the National Science and Technology Council as ""the integration of sensors, controls, and software platforms to optimize performance at the production unit, plant, and supply chain levels. "" Such digital integration, facilitated by what is being called the Industrial Internet of Things, allows for real-time decision-making via data analytics, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as machine learning. A chorus of voices-from consulting firms, market research firms, manufacturers, and government agencies-believe that owners of smart factories will reap huge economic rewards from enhanced sensing and monitoring, seamless data transmission , new waves of automation, and analysis of big data. Some market forecasts suggest that these factors can produce $1 trillion in added value by 2025-which could translate into a doubling of operating profit for a typical manufacturing firm. In the minds of many, digitalization represents the next industrial revolution. Getting there, however, won't be easy. It will require massive investment in capital equipment, labor (new skills will be needed), and technology (R&D). And it will be shaped by information governance-norms of behavior for the creation, transmission, storage, analysis, use, valuation, security, and deletion of information. These norms of behavior-or rules-are still evolving. Drawn by the high stakes, leading manufacturing nations have come to the table to set the rules. Whichever nation prevails will provide its domestic producers with a competitive edge. Leadership in information governance will provide a first-mover advantage to the nation's manufacturing sector."

Where is this data coming from? Start your free trial today Email Fashion has always been a hotbed for innovation — from the invention of the sewing machine to the rise of e-commerce. Like tech, fashion is forward-looking and cyclical. It’s also a huge industry. The ~$2.4T fashion sector is one of the largest industries in the global economy. Research BRIEFING: Surviving the Retail Apocalypse How are brick-and-mortar retailers surviving and adapting in the world of digital commerce? Email And today, tech is transforming fashion at a faster pace than ever. From robots that sew and cut fabric, to AI algorithms that predict style trends, to VR mirrors in dressing rooms, technology is automating, personalizing, and speeding up every aspect of fashion. In this report, we dive into the trends reshaping how our clothes and accessories are designed, manufactured, distributed, and marketed. Table of Contents Product Design AI becomes the designer How AI is influencing brands Manufacturing No more fashion seasons Rapid iteration & production Streamlining the supply chain 3D printing personalized products Robot designs for the manufacturing floor Inventory & Distribution RFID for verification, automation, & online integration Blockchain in the supply chain Distribution scales down D2C brands shun physical retail Retail & Virtual Merchandising AR/VR redefines the online and in-store experience Digital stylists get personal What’s Next? Tech Fashions to Watch Connected jewelry, apparel, & footwear 3D scanning Novel fabrics Closing thoughts Product Design Tech is automating the fashion designer. Fashion brands of all sizes and specialties are using technology to understand customers better than ever before. Project Muse As those data collection efforts grow more sophisticated, artificial intelligence will reshape brands’ approach to product design and development, with a focus on predicting what customers will want to wear next. AI Becomes The Designer Google has already tested the waters of user-driven AI fashion design with Project Muze, an experiment it deployed in partnership with German fashion platform Zalando. The project trained a neural network to understand colors, textures, style preferences, and other “aesthetic parameters,” derived from Google’s Fashion Trends Report as well as design and trend data sourced by Zalando. From there, Project Muze used an algorithm to create designs based on users’ interests and alignment with the style preferences recognized by the network. Amazon is innovating in this area as well. One Amazon project, led by Israel-based researchers, would use machine learning to assess whether an item is “stylish” or not. Another, out of Amazon’s Lab126 R&D arm in California, would use images to learn about a particular fashion style and create similar images from scratch. If that sounds like “fast fashion by Amazon,” that’s because it probably is. The e-commerce giant has also patented a manufacturing system to support on-demand apparel-making. The tech could be used to support its Amazon Essentials line or the suppliers in Amazon’s logistics network. Of course, the outcomes of human-free AI design aren’t always runway-ready. Many designs created for users of Google’s Project Muse were just unwearable scrawls and scribbles, while some reports on the Amazon Lab126 initiative called the design results “crude.” Clearly, much more R&D is needed before brands rely on AI-only designers. But artificial intelligence is already helping brands create and iterate their designs more quickly."

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) constitute a major portion of the German economy, accounting for a large proportion of country’s businesses and total employment. According to the most recent estimates, the SME sector, including services, 99.8% of the total number of enterprises, 76.7% of total employment, 38% of capital investment, 25% of value added, roughly 10% of exports and 5% of bank credit. Therefore, while SMEs dominate the economy in terms of employment, they evidently operate with comparatively little capital equipment, generate relatively low levels of value added, make only a small contribution to German exports. In order to change that situation Industry 4.0 is seen a favorable opportunity by authorities to increase value-added services and share of made German exports. Because Industry 4.0 reduces non-value-added data manipulation, improves OEM/SME based supply chain communications, enhances SME supply chain business performance, addresses interoperability concerns across both technical and business domains of the digital enterprise, opens new manufacturing technological career opportunities and integrates the human in the digital world to enhance decision making. Other opportunities for SMEs include Combined Augmented Reality and Modeling and Simulation can reduce errors that drive operational costs when physically implemented, use of Cloud Based tools and computing will enhance business and technical data analysis and decision making, IoT will provide for not only factory data to be integrated but also data from fielded products, robots interacting to perform repeatable complex tasks and improve output quality and cross domain and functional integration will greatly improve communications. Within relation to this; paper mainly includes 4 sections. It starts with the introduction and in that part Industry 4.0 and SMEs structure in Germany is broadly defined. In section 2, theoretical roots in other words literature review on the subject will be presented. Causal effects of challenges related to Industry 4.0 will be explained and related problems et cetera will be discussed in detail. In section 3, after explaining the Industry 4.0, insight will be brought up for discussion like what its economic potential is and will Industry 4.0 will be a massacre of employment in future or it is only exaggeration? After that special focus will be given to Germany and the situation in Germany will be explained in terms of Industry 4.0’s effects on SMEs. Section 4 will include conclusion. Besides giving insight about Industry 4.0 for comparison purposes between different purposes, the purpose of this paper is to provide information for the potential researchers about basic effects of Industry 4.0."

Much of this research has focused on pricing policies, protection against piracy, and governmental policies in the software industry. In this research, we focus on pricing policies of producers of digital experience goods. We consider a heterogeneous consumer market with different segments, each having a different affinity to piracy. We analyze the effect of different producer pricing policies on the revenue of the creator of the product, who may be different than the producer. Our results indicate that the explicit incorporation of these different consumer segments will cause the producer to charge lower prices and, therefore, lead to higher legal product diffusion. We show that the royalty system does not solve the double marginalization problem and is suboptimal from a supply-chain perspective. Also, the creator of the goods prefers a lower price than the producer's optimal price, and this tendency increases with the creator's per unit royalty. © 2008 M.E. Sharpe, Inc."

Traditionally, decision makers can determine the best supplier from evaluating few suppliers with qualitative supplier selection criteria by using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), but evaluate dozens of global suppliers simultaneously or determine the order quantity from them will be complex and difficult. Meanwhile, decision makers can determine the order quantity form the suitable suppliers by using fuzzy goal programming (FGP); however, it is not easy to decide weights for each goal of global supplier selection with different supply chain strategies. This study integrated the FAHP and FGP (FAHP-FGP) method to be a new approach for global supplier selection in considering the manufacturer's supply chain strategies. With FAHP-FGP method, the manufacturer can consistently integrate multi-manager' opinions in determining weights of each goal and obtain the order quantities for suitable suppliers based on manufacturer's strategies.

Since a traceability system collects every necessary information at every stage in a supply chain, it is also an efficient tool for monitoring and optimizing the production procedure. Adopting information technology to digitalize the business process is an inevitable trend to improve the efficiency in information management and especially quickly detect fraud problems. However, with the digitized process via a computer software system, the challenge remains as to whether digitized data is real. The reality shows that changing digital data is easier than paper-based data. Thus, it is necessary to have a digitalized process and a secure mechanism for ensuring transparency, correctness, and consistency of data leading to more efficiency in incidents detection and trace problems tracing. An emerging technology, Blockchain, has attracted more attention after its great success in finance due to various dominant features in preventing data changes even from the internal system. Technically, Blockchain is a ledger that records the entire transaction history publicly on a network of peer-to-peer computers of the time. One common ledger will be shared among all collaborative organizations in an ecosystem to ensure data immutability and undeniable responsibility, thereby enhancing data transparency. Therefore, applying Blockchain technology in agriculture will improve the current traceability process, aiming to increase the responsibility of the objects in the process and transparency of information for consumers. In this paper, we propose a framework that utilizes Blockchain to robustize traceability systems. Additionally, our proposed framework is compliant with the GS1 standard to achieve high reliability and compatibility on a global scale."

For some time now, the development and operation of the opencast mines have been determined by a multitude of external and internal factors, which will continue to increase in number both today and in future - not least due to the transformation in energy systems. The rising number of factors influencing operational decisions calls for the improvement in and further development of processes and supporting IT and PDP systems - so-called operations management systems. This applies to all process levels - from long-term planning to the scheduling of high-capacity equipment - and along the entire coal process chain, starting with mining operations and ending with the coal consumer. The operations-management systems rely on GPS-based technology which records equipment deployment and delivers a digital image of the opencast-mine progress in near real-time. At the associated scheduling and planning levels, equipment deployment, material distribution and coal quality control are carefully prepared. The result is a set of precise instructions for the operator assistance systems on site. Cutting-edge information technology is used, with user-friendly operational concepts promoting acceptance and being key to success. Upcoming further-development activities focus on continued system integration and the automation of planning processes and equipment."

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate how the use of information technology (IT) and supply chain management initiatives (information sharing and collaboration) impact a company's performance in reverse logistics (RL). Design/methodology/approach – A survey based on a previous exploratory research and literature review was sent out to 600 US companies having substantial activities in RL. Issues addressed in the survey, such as IT types deployed, IT operational attributes, information sharing, and collaboration, involve multiple parties in multi-tier RL networks, extending beyond a simple buyer-supplier dyad. Findings – The results revealed that the type of IT used per se did not have a differential impact on a company's performance in RL. However, IT operational attributes positively affected RL performance and information sharing and collaboration are critical to RL performance. Practical implications – Investment in IT alone cannot improve a company's performance; managers should take full account of IT attributes when deciding IT in RL. IT operational attributes tend to support one another – an improvement in one would lead to improvements in the others. With no exception in RL, companies need to share information and collaborate with their partners. Originality/value – The paper reports an empirical survey of the IT use and collaboration practices in RL, and provides insights into the relationships and impacts of IT, RL operational attributes, information sharing, and collaboration on one another as well as on RL performance."

Design/methodology/approach – A survey was conducted with consumers in Hong Kong: in total, 216 consumers participated in the survey. A confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to check the validity and reliability of the scales. Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis. Findings – The findings showed that only store-related attributes of eco-fashion positively influence consumers’ eco-fashion consumption decision, yet, such relationship can be weakened by the price premium level of eco-fashion. Research limitations/implications – Fashion consumers’ response to product- and store-related attributes of eco-fashion is still important in predicting fashion consumers’ eco-fashion consumption decision. Fashion consumer environmental attitudes can predict fashion consumers’ eco-fashion consumption decision better than fashion consumers’ attitude towards eco-fashion. Practical implications – It is not enough for fashion companies to manufacture fashion clothing in an ethical production system and develop and design fashion clothing with sustainable and recyclable materials. They must also improve store-related attributes of eco-fashion to better satisfy fashion consumer needs, and should be cautious in the direct and moderating effect of price premium level of eco-fashion when determining the price premium level of eco-fashion. Originality/value – The paper contributes to research by advancing understanding on how consumers make ethical consumption decisions in purchasing fashion, and provides retailers with managerial insights into devising marketing plans to promote eco-fashion consumption, which facilitate fashion companies’ development of a sustainable fashion supply chain. Limitations and directions for future research are also presented in the paper.

Executives must pay attention to how their companies create value in both arenas--the marketplace and the marketspace. But the processes for accomplishing this are not the same in the two worlds. Managers who understand how to master both can create and extract value in the most efficient and effective manner. The stages involved in creating value in the physical world are often referred to as links in a value chain. The value chain is a model that describes a series of value-adding activities connecting a company's supply side with its demand side. By analyzing the stages of a value chain, managers have been able to redesign their internal and external processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness. However, the value chain model treats information as a supporting element of the value-adding process, not as a source of value itself. To create value with information, managers must look to the marketspace. The value-adding processes that companies must employ to turn raw information into new marketspace services and products are unique to the information world. In other words, the value-adding steps are virtual in that they are performed through and with information. Creating value in any stage of a virtual value chain involves a sequence of five activities: gathering, organizing, selecting, synthesizing, and distributing information. Just as someone takes raw material and refines it into something useful, so a manager today collects raw information and adds value through these five steps.

However, while experienced professionals can exploit these tools, novices have been empowered, as well. As a result, practices of many disciplines are becoming increasingly subject to disintermediation. Disintermediation is an economic concept rooted in banking and finance but is now more widely applied. It refers to the removal of ""middle men"" in a supply chain. Producers bypass traditional distribution channels involving an intermediary and deal with customers directly. Historically these intermediaries functioned as aggregators of information and services, supplying expertise or making up for inefficiencies in the system. By reducing or eliminating intermediaries such as agents and brokers, disintermediation costs less by servicing customers directly. Web-based business-to-customer transactions via the Internet represent common, contemporary examples of this. Additional examples range from online stock trading to real estate and travel agencies, industries transformed by an increasingly Internet-driven society. Similarly, advances in digital technology are suggesting that other disciplines that have enjoyed special status provided by professional licensure, such as architecture, engineering, and even the delivery mechanisms of higher education in general, are also showing signs of disintermediation. Entry into design disciplines such as architecture and engineering has traditionally been subject to rigorous educational and regulatory restrictions. The value of their services was linked to material efficiencies, optimization of construction sequences, and the ability to navigate the regulatory and legal requirements associated with a particular project. Architects and engineers provided expertise in aggregating the data and knowledge necessary for project delivery. The same can be said for access to higher education. Long-standing barriers including cost, scarcity of desired programs, geography, and a lack of qualified faculty are being minimized. Now, for-profit institutions like the University of Phoenix and StraighterLine (with its ""$99 / month for all the courses you can consume"" business plan) stand poised to dramatically lower these barriers. While reducing accessibility barriers is certainly admirable, the disintermediation associated with institutions such as these arguably results in undervaluing the faculty intermediaries traditionally involved. In this presentation, specific technological innovations driving disintermediation are identified, followed by a discussion of strategies for using these same technologies to ""re-intermediate"" the societal relevance and economic value of intermediaries in different professions.
